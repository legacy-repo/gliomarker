24861879,10.1093/neuonc/nou084,Neuro Oncol,2014,MiR-124 governs glioma growth and angiogenesis and enhances chemosensitivity by targeting R-Ras and N-Ras,"Background. Glioma is one of the most aggressive and lethal human brain tumors. Accumulating evidence shows that microRNAs play important roles in cancers, including glioma. Previous studies reported that miR-124 levels were downregulated in glioma specimens. Here, we further investigate the potential role of miR-124 in glioma. Methods. The expression levels of miR-124 were detected in glioma specimens by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The direct targets of miR-124 were identified by bioinformatics analysis and were further validated by immunoblotting and luciferase reporter assay. The effects of miR-124 on glioma cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to temozolomide were analyzed by Cell-Counting Kit 8 assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis. A xenograft model was used to study the effect of miR-124 on tumor growth and angiogenesis. Results. Expression levels of miR-124 were greatly downregulated in glioma specimens. related Ras viral oncogene homolog (R-Ras) and neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (N-Ras) were identified as direct targets of miR-124. MiR-124 inhibited glioma cell growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth and increased chemosensitivity to temozolomide treatment by negatively regulating the Ras family and its downstream signaling pathways: phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt and Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, overexpression of R-Ras rescued the inhibitory effects of miR-124. Meanwhile, overexpression of R-Ras and N-Ras restored miR-124-inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription activation. In clinical glioma specimens, protein levels of R-Ras and N-Ras were upregulated and inversely correlated with miR-124 expression levels. Conclusions. Taken together, these results revealed that miR-124 levels in tumor tissues are associated with glioma occurrence, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance and that miR-124 may be used as a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for glioma in the future.",carcinogenesis; glioma; miR-124; N-Ras; R-Ras,MIR124-1; MIR124-2; MIR124-3,miR-124,"Taken together, these results revealed that miR-124 levels in tumor tissues are associated with glioma occurrence, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance and that miR-124 may be used as a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for glioma in the future.",RNA Biomarker,miRNA,"Diagnositic,Therapeutic","Tier 3, Biomarker is validated in pre-clinical research",China,24,NA,NA,NA,NA,"II,III,IV",Tissue,qRT-PCR,NA,R-Ras; N-Ras,"1.

In the absence of endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, these alterations currently are considered to serve as a surrogate for upgrading IDHwt diffuse or anaplastic astrocytoma to GBM. Here, we set out to determine the distribution of EGFRamp, 7+/10, and pTERTmut by analyzing high-resolution copy-number profiles and next-generation sequencing data of primary brain tumors. In addition, we addressed the question whether combinations of partial gains on chromosome 7 and partial losses on chromosome 10 exhibited a diagnostic and prognostic value similar to that of complete 7+/10. Several such combinations proved relevant and were combined as the 7/10 signature. Our results demonstrate that EGFRamp and the 7/10 signature are closely associated with IDHwt GBM. In contrast, pTERTmut is less specific for IDHwt GBM. We conclude that, in the absence of endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, the detection of EGFRamp is a very strong surrogate marker for the diagnosis of GBM in IDHwt di use astrocytic tumors. The 7/10 signature is also a strong surrogate marker. However, care should be taken to exclude pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. pTERTmut is less restricted to this entity and needs companion analysis by other molecular markers to serve as a surrogate for diagnosing IDHwt GBM.

29558959,10.1186/s12943-018-0822-0,Mol Cancer,2018,Serum long noncoding RNA HOTAIR as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult primary brain tumor. Despite surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median survival rate is approximately 14 months. Although experimental therapies are in clinical trials for GBM, there is an urgent need for a peripheral GBM biomarker for measuring treatment response. As we have previously demonstrated that the long noncoding RNA HOX Transcript Antisense Intergenic RNA, or HOTAIR, is dysregulated in GBM and required for GBM cell proliferation, we hypothesized that HOTAIR expression may be utilized as a peripheral biomarker for GBM. HOTAIR expression was measured in serum from 43 GBM and 40 controls using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The PCR products were subsequently subcloned into pCR4-TOPOTA vectors for DNA sequencing. A ROC curve was also generated to examine HOTAIR's prognostic value. The amount of HOTAIR in serum exosomes and exosome-depleted supernatant was calculated by qRT-PCR. The relative HOTAIR expression was also investigated in 15 pairs of GBM serum and tumors. We detected HOTAIR in serum from GBM patients. HOTAIR levels in serum samples from GBM patients was significantly higher than in the corresponding controls (P < 0.0001). The area under the ROC curve distinguishing GBM patients from controls was 0.913 (95% CI: 0.845-0.982, P < 0. 0001), with 86.1% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity at the cut-off value of 10.8. HOTAIR expression was significantly correlated with high grade brain tumors. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis indicated a medium correlation of serum HOTAIR levels and the corresponding tumor HOTAIR levels (r = 0.734, P < 0.01). We confirmed via sequencing that the amplified HOTAIR from serum contained the HOTAIR sequence and maps to the known HOTAIR locus at 12q13.

Numerous studies have shown that genetic alterations in ATRX play a significant role in gliomas. This study aims to further determine the relationship between ATRX and glioma prognosis and identify possible mechanisms for exploring the biological significance of ATRX using large data sets.  Methods: We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and 130 immunohistochemical results to confirm the difference in ATRX mutations in high- and low-grade gliomas. An online analysis of the TCGA glioma datasets using the cBioPortal platform was performed to study the relationship between ATRX mutations and IDH1, TP53, CDKN2A and CDKN2B mutations in the corresponding TCGA glioma dataset. In combination with clinical pathology data, the biological significance of the relationships were analyzed. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses and annotations of all adjacent genes in the network were performedin the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and R language. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and the interactions of all adjacent nodes were analyzed by the String database and using Cytoscape software.  Results: In the selected TCGA glioma datasets, a total of 2,228 patients were queried, 21% of whom had ATRX alterations, which co-occurred frequently with TP53 and IDH1 mutations. ATRX alterations are associated with multiple critical molecular events, which results in a significantly improved overall survival (OS) rate. In low-grade gliomas, ATRX mutations are significantly associated with multiple important molecular events, such as ZNF274 and FDXR at mRNA and protein levels. A functional cluster analysis revealed that these genes played a role in chromatin binding and P53, and a link was observed between ATRX and IDH1 and TP53 in the interaction network. ATRX and TP53 are important nodes in the network and have potential links with the blood oxygen imbalance.

METHODS The medical records of patients newly diagnosed with glioma, acoustic neuroma, meningioma, or nonlesional epilepsy at 3 hospitals between January 2011 and February 2016 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. The values of NLR, dNLR, PLR, LMR, and PNI were compared among patients suffering from glioma, acoustic neuroma, meningioma, and nonlesional epilepsy and healthy controls by using nonparametric tests. Correlations between NLR, dNLR, PLR, LMR, PNI, and tumor grade were analyzed.

However, the relevance of miR-361-5p to migration and invasion of gliomas remains unknown.  Materials and methods: The relationship between miR-361-5p and SND1 expression was analyzed in 120 human gliomas and 8 glioma cell lines by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to identify SND1 as a target of miR-361-5p. The mechanisms through which miR-361-5p inhibits glioma cell migration and invasion were studied by in vitro assays.  Results: miR-361-5p expression was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and glioma cell lines, and was inversely correlated with glioma grades. However, SND1 expression was positively correlated with glioma grades and inversely correlated with miR-361-5p expression. miR-361-5p overexpression suppressed glioma cell migration and invasion through targeting SND1 and subsequently decreasing MMP-2 expression. In glioma cell lines, SND1 overexpression could partly reverse the antitumor effects of miR-361-5p.  Conclusion: The findings provide evidence that miR-361-5p directly targets SND1 to degradation and then reduces MMP-2 gene transcription, thus inhibiting glioma migration and invasion. miR-361-5p is an important tumor suppressor and a novel diagnostic biomarker of glioma, and miR-361-5p and SND1 are potential therapeutic candidates for malignant gliomas.",miR-361-5p; glioma; SND1; migration; invasion,MIR361,miR-361-5p,"miR-361-5p is an important tumor suppressor and a novel diagnostic biomarker of glioma, and miR-361-5p and SND1 are potential therapeutic candidates for malignant gliomas.",RNA Biomarker,miRNA,"Diagnositic,Therapeutic","Tier 3, Biomarker is validated in pre-clinical research",China,120,71,49,NA,NA,"II,III,IV",Tissue,"Immunohistochemistry,In situ hybridisation,qRT-PCR,Western Blot",NA,SND1,1.

The lack of reliable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic methods is one of the main  reasons for the high mortality of glioma.

Methods: We searched the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Knowledge, Embase, and PubMed databases. Related articles were assessed, and ORs with 95% CIs were calculated to examine the relationship between miRNA-200b expression levels and the World Health Organization (WHO) glioma grade, patients' sex and age, tumor size, and extent of surgical resection. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and stability of the pooled results of the included studies were also analyzed. MiR-200b expression in 87 human glioma tissues (50 high grade and 37 low grade) and matched 41 non-neoplastic brain tissues was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. Results: Five eligible studies involving 630 patients were included in the present meta-analysis.

Their dysregulation is common in cancer. However, ceRNA signatures have been poorly examined  in the invasive and aggressive phenotypes of mesenchymal glioblastoma (GBM). This study aims to characterize  mesenchymal glioblastoma at the mRNA-miRNA level and identify the mRNAs in ceRNA networks (micNET)  markers and their mechanisms in tumorigenesis.  Methods: The mRNAs in ceRNA networks (micNETs) of glioblastoma were investigated by constructing a  GBM ceRNA network followed by integration with a STRING protein interaction network. The prognostic  micNET markers of mesenchymal GBM were identified and validated across multiple datasets. ceRNA  interactions were identified between micNETs and miR181 family members. LY2109761, an inhibitor of  TGFBR2, demonstrated tumor-suppressive effects on both primary cultured cells and a patient-derived  xenograft intracranial model.  Results: We characterized mesenchymal glioblastoma at the mRNA-miRNA level and reported a ceRNA  network that could separate the mesenchymal subtype from other subtypes. Six genes (TGFBR2, RUNX1,  PPARG, ACSL1, GIT2 and RAP1B) that interacted with each other in both a ceRNA-related manner and in  terms of their protein functions were identified as markers of the mesenchymal subtype. The coding sequence  (CDS) and 3-untranslated region (UTR) of TGFBR2 upregulated the expression of these genes, whereas  TGFBR2 inhibition by siRNA or miR-181a/d suppressed their expression levels. Furthermore, mesenchymal  subtype-related genes and the invasion phenotype could be reversed by suppressing the six mesenchymal  marker genes.

Current challenges in the treatment of glioma are the accurate and timely diagnosis of brain glioma and targeted treatment plans. To investigate the diagnostic biomarkers and prospective role of miRNAs in the tumorigenesis and progression of glioma, we analyzed the expression of miRNAs and key genes in glioma based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database.  Methods: Of the 701 cases that were downloaded, five were normal and 696 were glioma. Then, 1626 differentially expressed genes were identified, and 173 aberrantly expressed miRNAs were calculated by edgeR. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Cytoscape software. A coexpression network was built by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). A cell scratch test and transwell, cell apoptosis and cell cycle assays were performed to validate the function of hsa-let-7b-5p.  Results: Based on crosstalk genes in the KEGG, PPI network, and WGCNA analyses, PLK1, CCNA2, cyclin B2 (CCNB2), and AURKA were screened as candidate diagnostic marker genes.

Searching for new markers of glioblastomas is of great signifcance for improving the diagnosis, prognosis  and treatment of glioma. Methods: Using the GEO public database, we combined 34 glioma microarray datasets containing 1893 glioma  samples and conducted genetic data mining through statistical analysis, bioclustering, and pathway analysis. The  results were validated in TCGA, CGGA, and internal cohorts. We further selected a gene for subsequent experiments  and conducted cell proliferation and cell cycle analyses to verify the biological function of this gene. Results: Eight glioblastoma-specifc diferentially expressed genes were screened using GEO. In the TCGA and CGGA  cohorts, patients with high CBX3, BARD1, EGFR, or IFRD1 expression had signifcantly shorter survival but patients  with high GUCY1A3 or MOBP expression had signifcantly longer survival than patients with lower expression of these  genes.

The proliferative index (PI) of tumor cells was  evaluated by Ki-67 staining, and the apoptotic index (AI)  was determined by flfluorometric TdT-mediated dUTP nick  end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The results showed that the  FRAT1 immunoreactivity score (IRS), PI, and AI of astro cytoma were 4.11 ± 3.86, 31.92 ± 20.00%, and 2.66 ±  1.66%, respectively, and all of them increased markedly  with the increase of pathologic grade of astrocytomas (P\0.001 for all). The PI in the FRAT1-positive group was  signifificantly higher than that in the FRAT1-negative group  (P\0.001). In addition, the PI was positively correlated  with FRAT1 IRS (P\0.001). Although there was no sig nifificant difference between the AI in the FRAT1-positive  group and that in the FRAT1-negative group (P = 0.123),  the AI was inversely correlated with FRAT1 IRS  (P = 0.022).

In the present study, the miRNA expression profile was examined in astrocytoma, a malignant and prevalent intracranial tumour in adults. Methods: We screened the expression profile of 200 miRNAs in a training sample set consisting of 84 astrocytoma samples and 20 normal adjacent tissue (NAT) samples using the method of stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR. The significantly altered miRNAs were validated in another independent sample set consisting of 40 astrocytoma samples and 40 NAT samples. The correlation of the miRNA levels with survival in astrocytoma samples was estimated by performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: After a two-phase selection and validation process, seven miRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples upon comparison to the NAT samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the great potential of the 7-miRNA profile to differentiate between tumours and normal brain tissues.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene function in a wide range of pathophysiological processes and are therefore emerging biomarkers for prostate cancer, hepatic cancer, and other tumor diseases. However, the effective use of lncRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis of glioma remains unproven. Methods:This study included 42 glioma patients and 10 healthy controls. lncRNA and mRNA microarray chips were used to identify dysregulated lncRNAs in tumor tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue, and SYBR Green-based miRNA quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions were used to validate upregulated lncRNAs. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the lncRNA identified as the candidate biomarker. Results:miR210HG levels were significantly higher in tumor tissue than in tumor-adjacent normal tissue in participating glioma patients. Serum miR210HG levels were also significantly higher in glioma patients than in healthy controls.

All cases were immunostained with Olig-2, Nogo-A, and synaptophysin. In 79 cases, the status of 1p/19q had already been assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Thus, in selected cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization was repeated in areas with numerous Nogo-A-positive neoplastic cells. Nogo-A was positive in 18 (75%) of 24 oligodendrogliomas, 8 (80%) of 10 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, 6 (20%) of 30 glioblastoma multiforme, and 2 (20%) of 10 pilocytic astrocytomas.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: miR-126 expression in cancer tissues, normal brain tissues, U87MG cells and normal astrocytes in glioma patients was quantitatively analyzed via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). U87MG cells were transfected with miR-126 mimics or miR-126 inhibitor, followed by veri cation via qRT-PCR. The cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion after transfection were analyzed using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. The expression levels of proteins related to phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PTEN/PI3K/Akt) pathway and double mouse minute 2 homolog (MDM2)-p53 pathway were detected via Western blotting. Moreover, the prognostic analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.  RESULTS: Results of qRT-PCR showed that the miR-126 expression in highly malignant glioma tissues and U87MG cells were significantly lower than those in normal brain cells, and its expression level was significantly higher or lower than that in negative control group after transfection with miR-126 mimics or inhibitor. Analyses of cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion revealed that the up-regulation of miR-126 could remarkably inhibit the in-vitro proliferation, migration and invasion and promote apoptosis of glioma cells, and vice versa. Results of Western blotting manifested that after overexpression of miR-126, PI3K, p-Akt and MDM2 protein levels in U87MG cells were significantly decreased compared with those in control group, but PTEN and p53 protein expressions were significantly increased, and vice versa. Besides, according to prognostic analysis, the prognosis of patients with a low miR-126 level was poorer.  CONCLUSIONS: The miR-126 expression is abnormally low in glioma cells, and miR-126 inhibits the course of glioma through targeted regulation of PTEN/PI3K/Akt and MDM2-p53 pathways, which, therefore, can be used as a new potential biomarker for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of glioma.

Genetic heterogeneity of GBM warrants extensive studies to gain a thorough understanding of the biology of this tumor. While there have been several studies of global transcript pro ling of glioma with the identification of gene signatures for diagnosis and disease management, translation into clinics is yet to happen. In the present study, we report a novel proteomic approach by using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by spot picking and analysis of proteins/peptides by Mass Spectrometry. We report Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) as a differentially expressed protein in the GBM cell line compared to human normal Astrocyte cells.  In addition to proteomic studies, we performed microarray analysis which further confirmed up regulation of GRP78 in GBM cells compared to human normal Astrocyte cells.  GRP78 has long been recognized as a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and can be induced by the ER stress response. Besides its location in the ER, GRP78 has been found in cell plasma membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, nucleus and other cellular secretions. GRP78 is implicated in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, immune escape, metastasis and angiogenesis, and its elevated expression usually correlates with a variety of tumor micro environmental stresses, including hypoxia, glucose deprivation, lactic acidosis and inflammatory response. GRP78 protein acts as a centrally located sensor of stress, which senses and facilitates the adaptation to the tumor microenvironment.

Micro-RNAs (miR); small RNA molecules, are stable in blood and play a crucial role in molecular processes in GBM. Thus it was aimed to investigate the clinical role of miR-221 and miR-222 among GBM cases as compared to healthy individuals and illustrate their role in patient's survival. Materials and methods Blood samples were withdrawn from 20 GBM cases before and after treatment, a group of 20 healthy individuals were served as control.

As data on BRAFKIAA1549 fusion transcript status remain mainly limited to children, we aimed to examine the diagnostic value of BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcripts across all age groups. Methods: BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcript status was examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of 105 primary pilocytic astrocytomas [median patient age: 17 years (1-74 years)].

Allelic losses on 1p, or on 1p and 19q, correlate with chemotherapy response and good prognosis in OG patients; however,the underlying mechanisms are not yet clearly defined. Therefore, we utilized a quantitative proteomics strategy that combined 8-plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling and two-dimensional liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC/MS/MS) to identify molecular signatures, reveal mechanisms, and develop predictive markers of OG patients with 1p loss of heterozygosity (LOH). An initial screening of four OG patients with 1p LOH and four without were identified,and 449 differentially expressed proteins were quantified, 13 of which were significantly different between the two groups.

However, any possible involvement of TMEM39A in cancer remains largely unknown. In the present report, we provide evidence that TMEM39A may play a role in brain tumors. Western blotting using an anti-TMEM39A antibody indicated that TMEM39A was overexpressed in glioblastoma cell lines, including U87-MG and U251-MG. Deep-sequencing transcriptomic profiling of U87-MG and U251-MG cells revealed that TMEM39A transcripts were upregulated in such cells compared with those of the cerebral cortex. Confocal microscopic analysis of U251-MG cells stained with anti-TMEM39A antibody showed that TMEM39A was located in dot-like structures lying close to the nucleus. TMEM39A probably located to mitochondria or to endosomes. Immunohistochemical analysis of glioma tissue specimens indicated that TMEM39A was markedly upregulated in such samples. Bioinformatic analysis of the Rembrandt knowledge base also supported upregulation of TMEM39A mRNA levels in glioma patients.

Quantitative RT- PCR analysis revealed that MAGE-D4 mRNA expression was overall up-regulated in 41 glioma specimens compared with that in 14 normal brain tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that 78% (21/27) glioma tissues expressed MAGE-D4 protein, which was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, but absent in any neuroglia cell of normal brain tissues.

The purpose of our study was to assess this association and determine how long before glioma diagnosis it may be observed. Methods We conducted a nested case-control study using serum specimens from the Janus Serum Bank cohort in Norway. Blood donors who were subsequently diagnosed with glioma (n = 594 case subjects), between January 1, 1974 to December 31, 2007, were matched with subjects without glioma (n = 1177 control subjects) for date of blood collection, 2-year age interval at blood collection, and sex. Respiratory allergen-specific and total IgE levels in the serum were measured using fluorescent assays. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression models stratified on sex and glioblastoma, the most common glioma subtype. Data were stratified on time from blood collection to tumor diagnosis to assess how long before glioma diagnosis the association could be observed. Results Among women, testing positive for allergen-specific IgE (>0.35 kUA/L) was associated with decreased risk of glioblastoma compared with testing negative (0.35 kUA/L; OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.93).

In this study,  we aimed to explore the potential role of H19/miR‐675/vitamin D receptor (VDR) in  the effect of CUR against glioma. Real‐time polymerase chain reaction and western‐  blot analysis were used to study the effect of CUR or 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D  (1,25(OH)2D3) on the expression of H19, miR‐675, and VDR. In addition, the effect  of H19 on VDR expression was also studied. Furthermore, the expression of H19,  miR‐675, and VDR between CUR‐loaded nanoparticles (NPs) and NP groups was  compared, and the interaction among H19, miR‐675, and VDR was analyzed by in‐  silicon and luciferase assays. In a dose‐dependent manner, CUR and 1,25(OH)2D3  both downregulated the expression of H19 and miR‐675 but increased the expression  of VDR.

Previously the authors have found that the nitrone compound OKN-007 (OKlahoma Nitrone 007; or disodium 4-[(tertbutyl-imino) methyl] benzene-1,3-disulfonate N-oxide) is effective against high-grade gliomas in various GBM rodent and human xenograft models. The purpose of the present study was to assess the levels of the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) in rodent gliomas treated with OKN-007 as well as determine the expression of LBP in human gliomas.  METHODS Microarray analysis was done to assess altered gene expression following OKN-007 administration in an F98 glioma model. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was incorporated to assess LBP levels in glioma tissues, as well as blood serum, comparing results in OKN-007-treated and untreated tumor-bearing animals. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess LBP levels in varying grades of human glioma tissue sections.  RESULTS Upon further assessment of gene expression fold changes in F98 gliomas in rats that received or did not receive OKN-007, it was found that the gene for LBP was significantly downregulated by OKN-007. Further investigation was done to see whether levels of LBP were affected by OKN-007 treatment in F98 gliomas. It was found that LBP could be detected not only in glioma tissue but also in blood serum of F98 glioma-bearing rats and that OKN-007 decreased the levels of LBP. It was also found that LBP levels are highly expressed in human high-grade glioma tissues.

27154922,10.1093/neuonc/now090,Neuro Oncol,2016,Diagnostic value of glutamate with 2-hydroxyglutarate in magnetic resonance spectroscopy for IDH1 mutant glioma,"Background. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene that are frequently observed in low-grade glioma are strongly associated with the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which is a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of IDH1 mutant glioma. However, conventional MR spectroscopy (MRS) - based noninvasive detection of 2HG is challenging. In this study, we aimed to determine the additional value of other metabolites in predicting IDH1 mutations with conventional MRS.  Methods. Forty-seven patients with glioma underwent conventional single voxel short echo time MRS prior to surgery. A stereotactic navigation-guided operation was performed to resect tumor tissues in the center of the MRS voxel. MRS-based measurements of metabolites were validated with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We also conducted integrated analyses of glioma cell lines and clinical samples to examine the other metabolite levels and molecular findings in IDH1 mutant gliomas.  Results. A metabolomic analysis demonstrated higher levels of 2HG in IDH1 mutant glioma cells and surgical tissues. Interestingly, glutamate levels were significantly decreased in IDH1 mutant gliomas. Through an analysis of metabolic enzyme genes in glutamine pathways, it was shown that the expressions of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 were reduced and glutamate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in IDH1 mutant gliomas. Conventional MRS detection of glutamate and 2HG resulted in a high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 72%, specificity 96%) for IDH1 mutant glioma.  Conclusions. IDH1 mutations alter glutamate metabolism. Combining glutamate levels optimizes the 2HG-based monitoring of IDH1 mutations via MRS and represents a reliable clinical application for diagnosing IDH1 mutant gliomas.

In this study, we sought to examine the expression of SHMT2 in glioma, the association between SHMT2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics, and the association of SHMT2 expression with prognosis in glioma patients. Methods: We evaluated the expression of SHMT2, Ki67, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and Glutathione S Transferase pi (GST-pi) in 150 glioma patients using immunohistochemistry assays. The associations among the expression of SHMT2, clinicopathological parameters, and outcome of glioma patients were statistically analysed. Results: The expression of SHMT2 was increased in gliomas compared to normal brain tissue and gradually increased with increasing WHO grade. The SHMT2 expression was positively correlated with Ki67 expression and WHO degree (p < 0.01) but was not correlated with other clinicopathological parameters, including sex, age, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), tumour diameter, MGMT, and GST-pi (p >0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analyses showed that SHMT2 expression and the WHO grade were independent prognostic indicators for glioma patients. Conclusion: The expression of SHMT2 in glioma was signifificantly increased compared to normal brain tissue. SHMT2 promoted tumour proliferation, and there was no association between SHMT2 and drug resistance mechanisms of glioma.

In this study, we tested the expression of MIR4697HG in glioma cells and detected the comparatively down-regulated expression. RAD1 is an upstream regulator for MIR4697HG. This study aimed at exploring the regulatory mechanism and function of RAD1/MIR4697HG/PRR12 axis in glioma. Methods: We profiled the expression of MIR4697HG in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues according to GEPIA database as well as in glioma cells by qPCR. Functional experiments confirmed relevant role of MIR4697HG in regulating glioma cell proliferation and migration. We also carried out luciferase reporter assay,pull down assay and RIP assay to verify the location and interaction among the indicated RNA molecules. Results: The expression of MIR4697HG is down-regulated significantly in glioma cells due to the up-regulated expression of RAD21. MiR-766-5p was identified functioning as a sponge for MIR4697HG and is sequestered by MIR4697HG. We also found either miR-766-5p inhibitor or PRR12 knockdown rescued the function depletion caused by MIR4697HG overexpression. In all, the down-regulated expression of MIR4697HG inhibited PRR12 to suppress glioma and led to the deterioration of glioma.

However, the mechanisms that drive the development of gliomas remain largely unknown. Emerging evidence has shown  that long noncoding RNAs are key factors in glioma pathogenesis. qRT-PCR analysis was used to assess the expression of  FTX and miR-342-3p in the different stages of gliomas in tissues. Bioinformatics tool DIANA and TargetSCan were used  to predict the targets of FTX and miR-342-3p, respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to test the  correlation between the expression levels of FTX, miR-342-3p, and astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). To examine the  role of FTX in regulating proliferation and invasion of glioma cells, specific siRNA was used to knockdown FTX, and MTT  (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and transwell assays were performed. Furthermore, rescue  experiments were performed to further confirm the regulation of miR-342-3p by FTX.

This study aimed to uncover the nuclear expression of NGF in astrocytoma and its biological significance. Methods Ninety-four paraffin-embedded astrocytoma specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) and hemotoxylin & eosin (HE) staining. Preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens and intraoperative snap-frozen astrocytoma tissues were assayed for NGF expression by ELISA and Western blotting. The outcome of patients who contributed samples was tracked. Each ten tissue samples from patients with traumatic brain injury who had received decompression surgery and CSF samples from patients undergoing spinal anesthesia but with no history of nervous system disease were taken as control. Results NGF-positive immunoreactive products were distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of astrocytoma, but were only located in the cytoplasm of traumatic brain injury (TBI) tissue. NGF nuclear-positive rate (NPR) of grades III-IV astrocytomas (70.0%) was higher than that of grades I-II astrocytoma (28.6%, P <0.05). NGF-NP expression positively correlated with the NGF concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (r=0.755, P <0.01).

Invasive growth is the key feature of glioma. We assessed the clinical usefulness of plasma tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), which has less molecular weight than metalloproteinases, as a potential blood biomarker for glioma. Methods A total of 285 patients and 59 normal subjects were studied. Plasma concentration of TIMP-1 was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma TIMP-1 was compared between normal and glioma patients, between patients with different pathological grades, and between patients with different prognoses. Longitudinal changes in plasma TIMP-1 during treatment were also evaluated. Plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 level was also assayed and its clinical usefulness was compared with that of TIMP-1.  Results Plasma TIMP-1 and MMP-9 were both increased in glioma patients compared with normal controls (TIMP-1: P <0.001; MMP-9: P=0.007). Plasma TIMP-1 increases with increased tumor grade. In Grade IV gliomas, plasma TIMP-1 significantly increased after ""successful removal"" of the tumor (paired samples t-test, before operation vs. during chemotherapy without recurrence, t = -2.131, P=0.038), but did not change significantly at the time of tumor recurrence (during chemotherapy without recurrence vs. after tumor recurrence, t = -0.652, P=0.632). High plasma TIMP-1 level correlated with better survival in Grade IV glioma patients (hazard ratio: 0.550, 95% CI: 0.101-1.000, P=0.036). In Grade IV gliomas, patients with higher plasma TIMP-1 had significantly longer survival time than those with lower plasma TIMP-1 level (25.23 vs. 18.95 months, log-rank P=0.045). Plasma MMP-9 did not show significant association with either the pathological grade or the prognosis of glioma patients.

21438658,10.3171/2011.2.JNS101451,J Neurosurg,2011,Quantitative fluorescence in intracranial tumor: implications  for ALA-induced PpIX as an intraoperative biomarker,"Object. Accurate discrimination between tumor and normal tissue is crucial for optimal tumor resection. Qualitative fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), synthesized endogenously following d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)  administration, has been used for this purpose in high-grade glioma (HGG). The authors show that diagnostically  significant but visually imperceptible concentrations of PpIX can be quantitatively measured in vivo and used to  discriminate normal from neoplastic brain tissue across a range of tumor histologies.  Methods. The authors studied 14 patients with diagnoses of low-grade glioma (LGG), HGG, meningioma, and  metastasis under an institutional review board-approved protocol for fluorescence-guided resection. The primary aim  of the study was to compare the diagnostic capabilities of a highly sensitive, spectrally resolved quantitative fluorescence approach to conventional fluorescence imaging for detection of neoplastic tissue in vivo.  Results. A significant difference in the quantitative measurements of PpIX concentration occurred in all tumor  groups compared with normal brain tissue. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of PpIX concentration as a diagnostic variable for detection of neoplastic tissue yielded a classification efficiency of 87% (AUC =  0.95, specificity = 92%, sensitivity = 84%) compared with 66% (AUC = 0.73, specificity = 100%, sensitivity = 47%)  for conventional fluorescence imaging (p < 0.0001). More than 81% (57 of 70) of the quantitative fluorescence measurements that were below the threshold of the surgeon's visual perception were classified correctly in an analysis  of all tumors.  Conclusions. These findings are clinically profound because they demonstrate that ALA-induced PpIX is a  targeting biomarker for a variety of intracranial tumors beyond HGGs. This study is the first to measure quantitative  ALA-induced PpIX concentrations in vivo, and the results have broad implications for guidance during resection of  intracranial tumors.

The newly introduced lipid-coated SPIOs, which imitate  biological cell surface and thus inherited innate nonfouling property, were utilized to reduce nonspecifc binding to  of-targeted cells and prevent agglomeration that commonly occurs in nanoparticles.  Results: The synthesized targeted EGFR-antibody-conjugated SPIO (EGFR-SPIO) nanoparticles were characterized  using dynamic light scattering, zeta potential assays, gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays, transmission electron  microscopy (TEM) images, and cell line afnity assays, and the results showed that the conjugation was successful.

However, the potential clinical significance of serum miR-100 in GBM remained unknown. OBJECTIVE We aimed to detect the expression level of serum miR-100 in patients with GBM and assess its potential diagnostic and prognostic value. METHODS Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to measure serum miR-100 levels in 95 GBM patients and 60 healthy volunteers. The association between serum miR-100 level and clinicopathological parameters as well survival of GBM patients was evaluated. RESULTS Our results revealed that serum miR-100 levels were significantly decreased in GBM patients compared with the healthy controls.

Methods: MGMT expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining in 72 cases of GBM which had been  classified as three molecular subtypes. The relationship between MGMT and P53, an important molecule for identification of proneural-like GBM, were further analyzed. The association between MGMT and patients' prognosis was  analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method, which was further validated by the data from 513 cases of GBM in the TCGA  database. Results: MGMT expression was lower in proneural-like subtype in 72 GBM cases (p < 0.001), and was  negatively correlated with P53 (r=-0. 6203, p < 0.001). This results was also verified by a validation group of 87  GBM cases (r=-0. 2950, p < 0.001).

The present study aimed to investigate the clinical and functional roles of miR-769-3p in glioma, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression levels of miR-769-3p in glioma tissues and cells. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to calculate the diagnostic value of miR-769-3p. The 5-year survival rate of patients was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis. Cell experiments were used to investigate the functional role of miR-769-3p in glioma. The gene target of miR-769-3p was predicted by TargetScan. Changes in the levels of Wnt signaling-related proteins were measured by western blotting. miR‐769‐3p was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and serum, as well as in glioma cell lines (P<0.001). miR-769-3p expression was significantly associated with the World Health Organization grade and Karnofsky performance score.

Co-deletions of total 1p and 19q are found in the majority of oligodendrogliomas and considered as a diagnostic marker and a prognostic indicator. The 1p status of astrocytomas has not yet been thoroughly examined. Using a chromosome 1 tile path array, we investigated 108 adult astrocytic tumours for copy number alterations. Total 1p deletions were rare (2%), however partial deletions involving 1p36 were frequently identified in anaplastic astrocytomas (22%) and glioblastomas (34%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with total 1p deletions had significantly longer survival (P ¼ 0.005). In nine glioblastomas homozygous deletions at 1p36 were identified.

Using real-time PCR, we assessed the expression of Notch genes including receptors (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4), ligands (JAG1, JAG2, and DLL3), downstream targets (HES1 and HEY2), regulator Deltex1 (DTX1), inhibitor NUMB along with transcriptional co-activator MAML1, and a component of gamma-secretase complex APH1A in 15 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient samples. Relative quantification was done by the 2ΔΔCt method; the data are presented as fold change in gene expression normalized to an internal control gene and relative to the calibrator. The data revealed aberrant expression of Notch genes in glioblastoma compared to normal brain. More than 85 % of samples showed high Notch1 (P= 0.0397) gene expression and low HES1 (P = 0.011) and DTX1 (P = 0.0001) gene expression. Our results clearly show aberrant expression of Notch genes in glioblastoma which can be used as putative biomarkers together with histopathological observation to improve diagnosis, therapeutic strategies, and patient prognosis.

Here, we showed that Par6 is an essential component in glioma tumorigenesis. Our results indicated the aberrant expression of Par6 in malignant glioma tissues and cell lines. We found that the regulation of Par6 expression induces cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed the effects of Par6 were associated with cyclin D1- regulated cell cycle progression in glioma cells. Moreover, our results demonstrated that the regulation of Par6 can enhance the activation of Akt/PI3K signaling pathway, and subsequently upregulate the expression level of GSK-3β protein, which then regulate cyclin D1-mediated cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, we found that TGF-β-induced the upregulation of Par6 expression may be involved in this process. The pathological analysis confirmed the correlation between Par6 expression and the prognosis in human glioma tissues, suggesting the regulation of Par6 expression regulates glioma tumorigenesis and progression.

We have previously shown  that BEHAB/brevican, an extracellular matrix protein in the  central nervous system, plays a role in the invasive ability of  gliomas. The mechanisms that underlie BEHAB/brevican  function are not yet understood, due in part to the existence  of several isoforms that may have different functions. Here we  describe for the first time the expression of BEHAB/brevican  in human brain and characterize two novel glioma-specific  isoforms, B/bsia and B/b#g, which are generated by differen tial glycosylation and are absent from normal adult brain and  other neuropathologies.

In situ hybridization, along with immunohistochemical and receiver operating characteristic analysis determined TCON (truncation value = 3.5) as highly sensitive and specific in GBM. Grade IV patients with glioma life span with different lncRNA staining scores were analyzed. TCON staining scores below 3.5 indicated poor prognosis (life span ranging from 0.25 to 7 months), even if the glioma was surgically removed. TCON decreased significantly in GBM, and showed a coexpressional relationship with Smad2 and protein kinase C α (PKCα). Overexpression of TCON reduced the proliferation on one hand and migration, invasion on the other. TCON also inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and glioma progression in vivo, based on a nude mouse tumorigenicity assay.

It represents approximately 56% of all thenewly diagnosed gliomas. Macrophages are one of the major constituents of tumor-infltrating immune cells in the human gliomas. The role of immunosuppressive macrophages is very well documented in correlation with the poor prognosis of patients sufering from breast, prostate, bladder and cervical cancers. The current study highlights the correlation between the tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes and glioma progression. We observed an increase in the pool of M2 macrophages in high-grade gliomas, as confrmed by their CD68 and CD163 double-positive phenotype. In contrast, less M1 macrophages were noticed in high-grade gliomas, as evidenced by the down-regulation in the expression of CCL3 marker. In addition, we observed that higher gene expression ratio of CD163/CCL3 is associated with glioma progression.

Experimental Design: We screened glioblastomas from a population-based study for  IDH1 mutations and correlated them with clinical data and other genetic alterations.  Results: IDH1 mutations were detected in 36 of 407 glioblastomas (8.8%). Glioblastoma  patients with IDH1 mutations were younger (mean, 47.9 years) than those with EGFR  amplification (60.9 years) and were associated with significantly longer survival (mean,  27.1 versus 11.3 months; P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations were frequent in glioblastomas  diagnosed as secondary (22 of 30; 73%), but rare in primary glioblastomas (14 of 377;  3.7%: P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations as genetic marker of secondary glioblastoma corre sponded to the respective clinical diagnosis in 95% of cases. Glioblastomas with IDH1  mutation diagnosed as primary had clinical and genetic profiles similar to those of sec ondary glioblastomas, suggesting that they may have rapidly progressed from a less  malignant precursor lesion that escaped clinical diagnosis and were thus misclassified  as primary. Conversely, glioblastomas without IDH1 mutations clinically diagnosed as  secondary typically developed from anaplastic rather than low-grade gliomas, suggest ing that at least some were actually primary glioblastomas, that may have been mis classified, possibly due to histologic sampling error.

The characterization of the cellular density can be performed, non invasively, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), since, this technique displays a goodresolution. Nevertheless MRI sensitivity is critical. Development of smart contrast agents appears useful to increase MRIsignal to noise ratio (SNR). Tumor invasiveness is correlated with high expression of integrins that can be targeted by RGDmotif. In this study, MRI contrast agents or fluorescent probes linked to RGD-peptides were used, in a glioma model, to assess the relation between RGD uptake/signal improvement/cell density and consequently tumor invasiveness. Experiments were performed in vitro with U87-MG glioma cells. Flow cytometry and microscopy experiments with RGD and iRGDalexa488 demonstrated that cell internalization was dependent on cell density. The internalization involved a clathrindependent endocytosis. Cytoskeleton and particularly the microtubules were concerned. Actin filaments played a minor role. The internalization was also dependent on the glycolysis and the oxidative phosphorylations. The cellular density modulated the importance of the endocytosis pathways and of the metabolism but not the cytoskeleton contribution. The internalization of the RGD-peptide associated to gadolinium chelate increased the SNR of U87 cells. Moreover, following the cell density augmentation, the SNR increased with a low amplitude but a trend was clearly determined.

As the involvement of miRNAs in the carcinogenesis is well known, we carried out a pilot study to identify, as potential biomarkers, differentially ex-pressed microRNAs in blood samples of patients affected by glioma. We studied the miRNAs' expression, by means of microarray and Real-Time PCR, in 30 blood samples from glioma patients and in 82 blood samples of patients suffering from: (a) various neurological disorders (n=30), (b) primary B-lymphoma of the Central Nervous System (PCNSL, n=36) and (c) secondary brain metastases (n=16).

In various malignant tumors, the role of HDGF in tumor progression and its use as a diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target have been extensively explored.However, the prognostic function and mitogenic role of HDGF in gliomagenesis are yet to be verified. In this study,we found a significant incidence of HDGF prevalence between the different pathological types and stages of glioma in 105 patients. We also found a prognostic significance in 41 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, with prevalence of nuclear HDGF predicting short survival of patients with GBM after surgery.

17460461,NA,Am J Surg Pathol,2007,Caveolin-1 Expression is Variably Displayed in Astroglial-derived Tumors and Absent in Oligodendrogliomas: Concrete Premises for a New Reliable Diagnostic Marker in Gliomas,"Caveolins are basic constituents of ﬂask-shaped cell membrane microdomains (caveolae), which are involved in many cell functions, including signalling, traﬃcking, and cellular growth control. The distribution of caveolae within the normal brain and in brain tumors is controversial. In the present study, we describe the expression of caveolin-1 (cav-1) in 64 brain tumors of diﬀerent grade, of either astroglial or oligodendroglial origin. All studied astrocitomas of any grade (from II to IV) were cav-1 positive, displaying staining patterns and intensity speciﬁcally associated to the diﬀerent tumor grades. In all glioblastomas and gliosarcomas, cav-1 staining was extremely intense, typically localized at the cell membrane and recognized a variable percentage of cells, including the majority of spindle cells and palisade-oriented perinecrotic cells. In anaplastic astrocytomas, a less intense membrane staining or a cytoplasmic dotlike immunoreactivity were present, the latter being almost the exclusive pattern observed in diﬀuse astrocitomas grade II. In contrast to astroglial tumors, the striking totality of grade II oligodendrogliomas and the large majority of grade III were lacking cav-1 expression. Interestingly, a cav-1 distribution overlapping the pattern described in tissues was observed also in primary cell cultures of human glioblastomas and astrocytomas, and also in one established glioblastoma cell line (U251 MG), analyzed by means of confocal microscopy and ﬂow cytometry. In conclusion, among astroglial tumors cav-1 expression varies in distribution, pattern, and intensity speciﬁcally according to tumor types and grades. The association between tumor progression and a more structured membranous pattern of cav-1 expression could suggest the hypothesis of a neoplastic shift towards a mesenchymal phenotype, whose behavioral and biologic signiﬁcance worth further studies. Finally, the lack of cav-1 immunoreactivity in oligodendrogliomas suggests its concrete application as a useful diagnostic marker.",caveolin; brain tumors; glioblastoma; oligodendroglioma; marker,CAV1,cav-1,The lack of cav-1 immunoreactivity in oligodendrogliomas suggests its concrete application as a useful diagnostic marker.,Protein Biomarker,NA,Diagnositic,"Tier 2, Biomarker is validated in clinical trials or case reports",Italy,64,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I,II,III,IV",Tissue,Immunohistochemistry,NA,NA,"1.

This study aimed to investigate hematological markers with regard to tumor grades, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (IDH), age, and sex in patients with gliomas. Methods: From 2008 to 2017, patients with a pathological diagnosis of glioma who underwent surgery were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Information from clinical records, including age, sex, preoperative experiment tests (routine blood tests, biochemistry, and coagulation examinations), pathological results, and IDH status, was collected. A univariable survival analysis was performed. Hematological factors such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte-ratio (PLR), and albumin-to-globulin (AGR) were calculated. The prognostic nutrition index (PNI) was calculated as 10 × serum albumin value (g/dl) + 0.005 × peripheral lymphocyte count (per mm3 ). Results: Our study included 706 patients. The univariate analysis showed that age, IDH-1, and hematological factors were all significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in patients with gliomas. Our results showed that inflammation markers (NLR, PLR, and fibrinogen) were positively associated with age, whereas AGR was negatively associated with age. The PLR was significantly increased, whereas the AGR and PNI were decreased in women with gliomas, as compared with men. We found that inflammation markers increased and nutrition markers decreased with gliomas grade. However, these hematological markers did not significantly differ with IDH status. NLR was the best single hematological marker for distinguishing glioblastoma (GBM) [0.684 (0.645-0.723)], IDH-wt GBM [0.672 (0.631-0.71)] from other gliomas subtypes. Combinations of age with PNI and age with AGR were the best predictors of GBM [0.750 (0.713-0.786)] and IDH-wt GBM [0.759 (0.719-0.798)], respectively.

The purpose of this study was to identify a distinct radiological  feature for the preoperative differentiation of glioblastoma from its differentials, which include malignant lymphomas and  metastatic brain tumors. METHODS Preoperative MR images, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies (b = 1000 and 4000 sec/mm2 ),  obtained in patients with newly diagnosed malignant tumor, were analyzed retrospectively after receiving approval from  the institutional review board. Sixty-four patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma, 32 patients with malignant  lymphoma, and 46 patients with brain metastases were included. The presence of a nonenhancing peritumoral DWI  high lesion (NePDHL, i.e., hyperintense lesion in a nonenhancing peritumoral area on DWI) was confirmed in both DWI  sequences. Gray matter lesions were excluded. Lesions were termed ""definite"" if present within 3 cm of the hyperintense tumor border with a signal intensity ratio  30% when compared with the contralateral normal white matter in both  sequences. Discriminant analysis between the histological diagnosis and the presence of Definite-NePDHL was performed, as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analysis incorporating the existence of Definite-NePDHL. RESULTS In 25% of glioblastoma patients, Definite-NePDHL was present, while it was conspicuously absent in patients  with malignant lymphoma and metastatic brain tumors. The specificity and positive predictive value were 100%. In the  glioblastoma subset, a higher preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale score (p = 0.0028), high recursive partitioning  analysis class (p = 0.0006), and total surgical removal (p = 0.0012) were associated with better median overall survival.  Patients with Definite-NePDHL had significantly early local (p = 0.0467) and distant/dissemination recurrence (p <  0.0001) and poor prognosis (p = 0.0007).

Patients with GBM have a median overall survival of only  14.6 months. Current treatment consists of safe and maximal surgical excision, followed by  concurrent chemoradiotherapy and maintenance chemotherapy. There are several obstacles that  hinder the effectiveness of this aggressive treatment. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating  drug that acts through alkylating the O6  position of guanine in DNA that leads to cell death.  However, the expression and enzymatic activity of the DNA repair protein MGMT limits the  therapeutic benefit from treatment with TMZ. MGMT reduces the efficacy of alkylating drugs  by removing the methyl or alkyl group from damaged O6 -methylguanine.

Malignant glioma  is one of the most devastating and lethal forms of intrinsic CNS tumor. Here, the authors evaluated serum miRNA 205  (miR-205) levels in patients with glioma. Methods Sixty-four patients in whom glioma was diagnosed and 45 healthy controls were recruited between October  2011 and March 2012 and randomly assigned to the screening cohort or the validation cohort. Cohorts of patients with  other brain tumors, including meningioma (n = 8), primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the CNS (n = 6), and pituitary  adenoma (n = 5), were investigated and compared. miR-205 extraction from serum was detected by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to perform survival analysis,  the risk factors were analyzed by using a Cox regression model, and the receiver operating characteristic working curve  was used to analyze the value of miR-205 in the prognostic evaluation of the patients. Results The authors first demonstrated that serum miR-205 expression was significantly lower in patients with glioma  than in healthy controls (p < 0.001). It is important to note that serum miR-205 expression demonstrated a stepwise decrease with ascending pathological grades. The serum miR-205 biomarker had high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy  in patients with glioma. Serum levels of miR-205 were identified as an individual diagnostic marker and were significantly  lower in the glioma cohort than in the other brain tumor cohorts. Serum miR-205 levels were significantly increased in  postoperative samples over those in the preoperative samples and were reduced again during glioblastoma recurrences.  Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between low serum miR-205 expression and both ascending pathological grades (p = 0.002) and low Karnofsky Performance Scale scores (p = 0.01). Patients with glioma at an advanced  pathological grade (Grade III or IV) and a higher miR-205 serum level showed longer overall survival than those with a  lower miR-205 serum concentration (p < 0.01).

However, the potential role of serum miR-145-5p in the diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) remains poorly known. This study was designed to explore the clinical significance of serum miR-145-5p in patients with GBM. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to measure the serum levels of miR-145-5p in 117 GBM patients, 52 grade I/II glioma patients and 50 healthy volunteers. The associations between serum miR-145-5p level and the clinical variables as well as prognosis were analyzed. The bioinformatic analysis of the downstream targets of miR-145-5p was also performed.

This study aims to examine if the analysis of OLIG2 and ID2 expression in glioma tissues helps the differential diagnosis of chemosensitive oligodendroglial tumors from astrocytic tumors. Expression levels of OLIG2 and ID2 in 11 oligodendroglial and 27 astrocytic tumors were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), real-time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry. The mean expression level of OLIG2 was higher in oligodendroglial tumors than astrocytic tumors, but some astrocytic tumors showed high OLIG2 expression, indicating that OLIG2 cannot be an independent marker of oligodendroglial tumors. No significant difference was observed between ID2 expression in oligodendroglial tumors and astrocytic tumors. It was notable that OLIG2 expression was predominant over ID2 expression in oligodendroglial tumors, while ID2 expression was predominant over OLIG2 expression in astrocytic tumors. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed that gliomas with loss on chromosome 1p, which is closely associated with chemosensitivity, also showed the predominant expression of OLIG2 over ID2.

To test this proposition, we have analyzed the expression of a neural RNA-binding protein, Musashi1, in primary human central nervous system (CNS) tumors. In rodents, Musashi1 is expressed predominantly in proliferating multipotent neural precursor cells, but not in newly generated postmitotic neurons. The expression of Musashi1 is downregulated with the successive progression of neurogenesis. In normal adult human tissues, we detected low levels of Musashi1 expression in brain and testis by RT-PCR analysis. In an RNA panel of 32 cancer tissues and cell lines, elevated expression of Musashi1 was seen in all five malignant gliomas studied, in contrast to the slight expression seen in other tumor cells, including those in several melanomas and a prostate cancer. Western blot analysis showed strong Musashi1 expression in malignant gliomas compared with nonneoplastic brain tissue. Glioblastomas, the most malignant form of glioma, showed higher Musashi1 expression than less malignant gliomas by immunohistochemical analysis. Tumors with strong Musashi1 expression tended to have high proliferative activity. Thus, the expression of Musashi1 correlated with the grade of the malignancy and proliferative activity in gliomas.

In this study, we inves tigated a new anticancer miRNA, miR-346, to determine the efects and mechanism of miR-346 and its downstream target gene NFIB on tumors.Methods: Lentivirus transfection, real-time PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, cell proliferation assays, and mouse experiments were used to examine the relationship between miR-346 and its regulation of NFIB in glioma cells.Results: The expression of miR-346 was downregulated in glioma cells. Overexpression of miR-346 arrested the cell cycle of glioma cells and inhibited their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. NFIB was a direct target of miR-346, whose expression was reduced by the miRNA.

Increasing TAC was associated with low-grade histology and decreasing TAC with high-grade histology. This prospective study analyzed whether these patterns correlate with distinct biological tumor subtypes and differential outcome. 18F-FET PET-guided biopsies were used for stepwise histopathological evaluation. Molecular-genetic evaluation included O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) mutational and 1p/19q codeletion status. Progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were obtained from multivariate regression models. 98 adult patients were included. Homogeneous increasing, focal decreasing and homogeneous decreasing TAC were seen in 51, 19 and 28 patients. The corresponding 1-year (2-years) PFS were 92% (85%), 89% (51%) and 50% (28%; p=0.002).

Their involvement in certain cancers such as breast and colon cancer is known but in gliomas it remains unexplored till date. The aim of this study was to assess the status of adipokines as prognostic markers of gliomas (low grade gliomas [LGG] and glioblastoma mutiforme [GBM]). Expression status (messenger RNA [mRNA]), overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS) was identified using gene expression profiling interactive analysis server. Clinicopathological analysis and correlation between different adipokines was performed using Xena server. Protein expression status was analyzed using tissue sections from the Human Protein Atlas. Out of 11 adipokines studied visfatin (NAMPT), apelin (APLN), granulin (GRN), serpin peptidase inhibitor/plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI‐1) member 1 (SERPINE1), and chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in both LGG andGBM.Interleukin6(IL6)mRNA was found be significantly upregulated only in GBM. NAMPT, GRN, SERPINE1, and IL6 showed reduced OS as well as worst DFS for patients having higher mRNA expression in LGG. Increased expression of CCL2 showed worst OS in LGG patients while resistin (RETN) and GRN showed the worst OS in GBM patients. Higher expression of RETN, GRN, IL6, SERPINE1, and CCL2 were found to be positively correlated with shorter DFS in GBM. In the clinicopathological analysis, NAMPT, GRN, IL6, SERPINE1, and CCL2 expressions were significantly associated between the neoplasm histological G2 and G3 grades. Furthermore, expression of NAMPT, GRN, tumor necrosis factor, IL6, SERPINE1, and CCL2 were significantly associated with histological type in LGG patients.

Preliminary screening of an array of tumors implicated proteases (including matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs]) and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase [TIMPs]) as well as growth factors (including basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) as candidate biomarkers. These data led the authors to hypothesize that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) and bFGF would represent high-probability candidates as JPA-specific biomarkers.Methods Urine was collected from 107 patients, which included children with JPA (n = 21), medulloblastoma (n = 17), glioblastoma (n = 9), arteriovenous malformations (n = 25), moyamoya (n = 14), and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 21).

Molecular biomarkers including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and O6methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation may improve prognostication and guide treatment decisions for patients with World Health Organization (WHO) anaplastic gliomas. At present, each marker is individually tested by distinct assays. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays (HM450) enable the determination of large-scale methylation profiles and genome-wide DNA copy number changes. Algorithms have been developed to detect the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G- CIMP) associated with IDH1/2 mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT promoter methylation using a single assay. Methods. Here, we retrospectively investigated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of these algorithms in comparison to individual marker testing and patient outcome in the biomarker cohort (n 1⁄4 115 patients) of the NOA-04 trial. Results. Concordance for IDH and 1p/19q status was very high: In 92% of samples, the HM450 and reference data agreed. In discordant samples, survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses suggested a more accurate assessment of biological phenotype by the HM450 analysis. The HM450-derived MGMT-STP27 model to calculate MGMT promoter methylation probability revealed this aberration in a significantly higher fraction of samples than conventional methylation-specific PCR, with 87 of 91 G-CIMP tumors predicted as MGMT promoter-methylated. Pyrosequencing of discordant samples confirmed the HM450 assessment in 14 of 17 cases. Conclusions.

Although there is  high potential for a role of Cripto‐1 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  pathogenesis and progression, few studies have tried to define its role in GBM.  These studies were limited in that Cripto‐1 expression was not studied in detail in  relation to markers of cancer initiation and progression. Therefore, these  correlative studies allowed limited interpretation of Criptos‐1's effect on the  various aspects of GBM development using the U87 GBM cell line. In this study,  we sought to delineate the role of Cripto‐1 in facilitating pathogenesis, stemness,  proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis in GBM. Our findings show  that upon overexpressing Cripto‐1 in U87 GBM cells, the stemness markers  Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and CD44 increased expression. Similarly, an increase in Ki67  was observed demonstrating Cripto‐1's potential to induce cellular proliferation.  Likewise, we report a novel finding that increased expression of the markers of  migration and invasion, Vimentin and Twist, correlated with upregulation of  Cripto‐1. Moreover, Cripto‐1 exposure led to VEGFR‐2 overexpression along with  higher tube formation under conditions promoting endothelial growth. Taken  together our results support a role for Cripto‐1 in the initiation, development,  progression, and maintenance of GBM pathogenesis.

Establishment of serum biomarkers for glioma would be beneficial both for early diagnosis and adequate therapeutic intervention. Filamins are an actin cross-linker and filamin C (FLNC), normally restricted in muscle tissues, offers many signaling molecules an essential communication fields. Recently, filamins have been considered important for tumorigenesis in cancers. Methods: We searched for novel glioma-associated antigens by serological identification of antigens utilizing recombinant cDNA expression cloning (SEREX), and found FLNC as a candidate protein. Tissue expressions of FLNC (both in normal and tumor tissues) were examined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Serum anti-FLNC autoantibody level was measured by ELISA in normal volunteers and in the patients with various grade gliomas. Results: FLNC was expressed in glioma tissues and its level got higher as tumor grade advanced. Anti-FLNC autoantibody was also detected in the serum of glioma patients, but its levels were inversely correlated with the tissue expression. Serum anti-FLNC autoantibody level was significantly higher in low-grade glioma patients than in high-grade glioma patients or in normal volunteers, which was confirmed in an independent validation set of patients' sera. The autoantibody levels in the patients with meningioma or cerebral infarction were at the same level of normal volunteers, and they were significantly lower than that of low-grade gliomas. Total IgG and anti-glutatione S-transferase (GST) antibody level were not altered among the patient groups, which suggest that the autoantibody response was specific for FLNC.

Here, we further investigate the potential role of  miR-433 in glioma. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that miR-433-3p and  miR-433-5p were low expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines. Functional studies  suggested that the overexpression of miR-433-3p suppressed proliferation, induced  apoptosis and inhibited invasion and migration of human glioma cells. But the growth  and metastasis of glioma cells were not significantly influenced by overexpression of  miR-433-5p. In a xenograft model, we also showed that miR-433-3p had an inhibitory  effect on the growth of glioma. Bioinformatics coupled with luciferase and western blot  assays revealed that CREB is a direct target of miR-433-3p, and the overexpression  of CREB can rescue the phenotype changes induced by miR-433-3p overexpression.  Besides, miR-433-3p could increase chemosensitivity of glioma to temozolomide by  targeting CREB in vitro and in vivo.

27753657,NA,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,2016,A Comparative Immunohistochemical Study of Epithelial Membrane Antigen and NHERF1/EBP50 in the Diagnosis of Ependymomas,"Ependymomas are gliomas that recapitulate normal ependymal cells. The epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) shows ""dot-like"" and ""ring-like"" staining patterns, highlighting ""microlumens"" or intracytoplasmic rosettes, a pathognomonic ultrastructural feature. NHERF1/EBP50, an adaptor protein localized at the apical plasma membrane of human epithelia, has been found to localize to these microlumens. We aimed to analyze the staining patterns of EMA and EBP50 in ependymomas and other tumors, and thereby compare their diagnostic utility. Sixty-three ependymomas of different grades and 44 nonependymal tumors (meningiomas, 5; pilocytic astrocytoma, 2; paraganglioma, 2; neurocytoma, 4; pituitary adenoma, 3; papillary tumor of pineal region, 3; oligodendroglioma, 4; choroid plexus papilloma, 3; medulloblastoma, 2; schwannoma, 2; cellular hemangioblastoma, 2; subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, 1; glioblastoma multiforme, 8; diffuse astrocytoma, 1; anaplastic astrocytoma, 1; and pilomyxoid astrocytoma, 1) were included. Ring-like positivity was 100% specific for ependymomas, but showed a poor sensitivity (EMA, 29%; EBP50, 37%). Dot EMA positivity was more sensitive in grade III ependymomas (100%), whereas dot EBP50 positivity was more sensitive in grade I subependymomas (80%) and myxopapillary ependymomas (40%). Among grade II ependymomas, EBP50 labeled a significantly higher number of dots and rings, which may be of value in small biopsies. Focal dot positivity for EMA and EBP50 in glioblastoma multiforme and meningioma contributed to the lowered specificity (EMA, 84%; EBP50, 80%). Myxopapillary ependymomas (60%), choroid plexus papillomas (66%), and papillary tumors of pineal region (100%) showed membranous staining with EBP50. Although EPB50 appears to be a better diagnostic marker for grade I/II ependymomas, we recommend a combined panel of EMA and EBP50 for grade III ependymomas to compensate for the reduced sensitivity of EBP50 in this subgroup.Normal ependymal cells lining the ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord are arranged as a single layer of cuboidal cells with adherens junctions, basally located nuclei, and a specialized apical plasma membrane that contains cilia and microvilli. They resemble glandular epithelial cells, but differ in lacking well-defined basement membranes, desmosomes, and tonofilaments.1 Ependymomas are relatively rare central nervous system (CNS) tumors that recapitulate the light microscopic and ultrastructural features of normal ependymal cells.2 Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells typically exhibit numerous microvilli and cilia in the cytoplasm and on the surface, in addition to cell junctions and basement membrane-like structures.3 Intracytoplasmic lumen or microlumen (ML) formation is a highly characteristic ultrastructural feature,4 and these lumens contain microvilli with or without cilia. Ciliated MLs are hypothesized to originate from the distention of the periciliary cisterns, which subsequently enlarge by fusion with cytoplasmic vesicles or other MLs. When they communicate with the intercellular spaces, they form the true ependymal rosettes (TER) and true ependymal canals (TEC) seen on light microscopy.4 Nonciliated MLs are less commonly seen and possibly represent a degenerative phenomenon or invaginations of the extracellular space.4 According to the latest World Health Organisation classification of tumors of the CNS, ependymomas are accorded 3 grades: grade I, including the subependymomas (SEs) of the ventricular surfaces and the myxopapillary ependymomas (MPEs) of the lumbosacral regions; grade II, classical ependymomas (EPII); and grade III, anaplastic ependymomas (EPIII).2 Common morphologic variants exhibiting papillary, tanycytic, or clear cell patterns may be seen in grade II or III ependymomas.2 The histopathologic diagnosis of ependymomas is straightforward in a classical case that shows the formation of TER and TEC. However, the latter are rare histologic findings and in most instances, specific immunohistochemistry is required to confirm the diagnosis.In addition, ependymomas exhibit a wide range of morphologic variations leading to a long list of potential histologic mimics.2 These include the following: oligodendrogliomas and neurocytomas in clear cell variants; medulloblastomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in cellular and anaplastic variants; choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs), papillary tumor of pineal region (PTPRs), and papillary meningiomas (MEs) in papillary variants; and pilocytic astrocytomas and schwannomas in tanycytic variants. Glial fibrillary acidic protein is the most commonly used immunohistochemical marker, but it does not help in differentiation from other gliomas. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) is another commonly used diagnostic marker, which shows ""dot-like"" and ""ring-like"" staining patterns,5 highlighting MLs.4,6 Recently, NHERF1/ EBP50 [Na+/H+ exchanger 3-regulating factor 1/ezrinradixin-moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein 50], an adaptor protein localized at the apical plasma membrane of human epithelia, has been found to localize to the MLs of ependymomas with high sensitivity and specificity, and is suggested as a superior diagnostic marker for ependymomas.7,8 We undertook this study to analyze the immunohistochemical staining patterns of EMA and EBP50 in ependymomas of all ages, sites, and grades, and other tumors that enter in the differential diagnosis, and thereby compare their specificities and sensitivities in the diagnosis of these tumors.",ependymoma; EMA; EBP50; meningioma; glioblastoma,NA,EMA; EBP50,"Although EPB50 appears to be a better diagnostic marker for grade I/II ependymomas, we recommend a combined panel of EMA and EBP50 for grade III ependymomas to compensate for the reduced sensitivity of EBP50 in this subgroup.",Protein Biomarker,NA,Diagnositic,"Tier 3, Biomarker is validated in pre-clinical research",India,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"II,III",Tissue,Immunohistochemistry,NA,NA,"1.

Although positron-emission tomography is considered valuable in the care of patients with gliomas, 18F-flfluorodeoxyglucose and  11C-methionine have reportedly shown ambiguous results in terms of grading and prognostication. The present study compared the diagnostic  and prognostic capabilities of diffusion tensor imaging, FDG, and 11C-methionine PET in nonenhancing gliomas.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-fifive consecutive newly diagnosed, histologically confifirmed nonenhancing gliomas that underwent  both FDG and 11C-methionine PET were retrospectively investigated (23 grade II and 12 grade III gliomas). Apparent diffusion coeffificient,  fractional anisotropy, and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios of both FDG and 11C-methionine PET were compared between grade II and III  gliomas. Prognostic values of these parameters were also tested by using progression-free survival.  RESULTS: Grade III gliomas showed signifificantly higher average tumor-to-normal tissue and maximum tumor-to-normal tissue than grade II  gliomas in 11C-methionine (P  .013, P  .0017, respectively), but not in FDG-PET imaging.

However, the status of zinc homeostasis and the expression profile of zinc transporters in brain and brain tumors have not been reported. Methods: The gene profiles of 14 zinc importers (ZIPs) and 10 zinc exporters (ZnTs) in patients with glioma were studied by investigating the association between the zinc transporters and brain tumor characteristics (tumor grade and overall survival time). Three independent cohorts were analyzed to cross-validate the findings: the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGCA) cohort (n = 186), the US National Cancer Institute Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) cohort (n = 335), and The University of Texas (UT) cohort (n = 34). Results: The expression of ZIP3, 4, 8, 14, ZnT5, 6, and 7 were increased, and the expression of ZnT10 was decreased in grade IV gliomas, compared with grade II gliomas. Among all 24 zinc transporters, ZIP4 is most significantly associated with tumor grade and overall survival; this finding is consistent across 2 independent cohorts (CGCA and REMBRANDT) and is partially validated by the third cohort (UT).

27385098,NA,Oncotarget,2016,TrkB-containing exosomes promote the transfer of glioblastoma  aggressiveness to YKL-40-inactivated glioblastoma cells,"The neurotrophin receptors are known to promote growth and proliferation of  glioblastoma cells. Their functions in spreading glioblastoma cell aggressiveness to  the microenvironment through exosome release from glioblastoma cells are unknown. Considering previous reports demonstrating that YKL-40 expression is associated  with undifferentiated glioblastoma cancer stem cells, we used YKL-40-silenced cells  to modulate the U87-MG differentiated state and their biological aggressiveness.  Herein, we demonstrated a relationship between neurotrophin-receptors and  YKL-40 expression in undifferentiated cells. Differential functions of cells and  derived-exosomes were evidenced according to neurotrophin receptor content and  differentiated cell state by comparison with control pLKO cells. YKL-40 silencing of glioblastoma cells impairs proliferation, neurosphere  formation, and their ability to induce endothelial cell (HBMEC) migration. The  modulation of differentiated cell state in YKL-40-silenced cells induces a decrease of  TrkB, sortilin and p75NTR cellular expressions, associated with a low-aggressiveness  phenotype. Interestingly, TrkB expressed in exosomes derived from control cells  was undetectable in exosomes from YKL-40 -silenced cells. The transfer of TrkBcontaining exosomes in YKL-40-silenced cells contributed to restore cell proliferation  and promote endothelial cell activation.

In view of this, we evaluated the expression of IGFBP isoforms (IGFBP-2, -3, and -5) during malignant progression of astrocytoma and their prognostic significance in glioblastoma.  Methods: The expression of IGFBP isoforms was analyzed in diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas by realtime quantitative PCR (n = 203) and immunohistochemistry (n = 256). Statistical methods were used to assess their grade-specific expression pattern and mRNA-protein intercorrelation. Survival analyses were done on a uniformly treated, prospective cohort of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (n = 136) by using Cox regression models.  Results: The mean transcript levels of IGFBP-2 and -3 were significantly higher in glioblastomas (GBM) relative to anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), diffuse astrocytoma (DA), and controls whereas IGFBP-5 mRNA was higher in GBM relative to AA and controls (P < 0.05).

To identify circulating tumor-derived proteins, mice were immunized with concentrated culture medium conditioned by human breast cancer cells. Antibodies generated by hybridomas were screened against conditioned media from both normal epithelial cells and tumor cells. Antibody selectively reacting with tumor cell-conditioned media was further characterized. This led to the development of a monoclonal antibody (Alper-p280) that reacts with a newly identified 280-kDa secreted variant of human filaminA.

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to determine the type and histological grade according to WHO (2007) classification of CNS tumors. Immunostaining was done using anti p53 and CD31 and the results were measured as labeling index (LI) using image analyzer system CAS-200. Results Both p53 and CD31 expressions were correlated well with the histopathological grades of different subtypes of astrogliomas with good discrimination between low and high grades. Overall, a highly significant statistical correlation was observed between the grades of astrocytomas and the p53 and CD31 labeling indices. The expressions of p53 and CD31 were markedly increased in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with mean values (59.7 ± 13.5) (P = 0.0001) and (40.7 ± 8.9) (P = 0.001), respectively. Obviously, these observations demonstrate that the co-expression and increased levels of p53 and CD31 in astrogliomas are increasing as the tumor grade is increasing. Conclusion The estimation of p53 and CD31 could be used as good tools to assess the grade, prognosis, and aggressiveness of the astroglial tumors. Thus, the two markers can be used as adjunct to the diagnosis and stratification of the high grade from the low-grade intrinsic brain astrogliomas.",Astroglial brain tumors; p53 and CD31 immunostaining; Image analyzer system CAS-200,TP53; PECAM1,p53; CD31,"Thus, the two markers can be used as adjunct to the diagnosis and stratification of the high grade from the low-grade intrinsic brain astrogliomas.",Protein Biomarker,NA,"Diagnositic,Therapeutic","Tier 2, Biomarker is validated in clinical trials or case reports",Egypt,45,33,12,35.02,35.02(0.92-70),I,Tissue,Immunohistochemistry,NA,NA,"1.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in adults, and its prognosis remains dismal despite intensive research and therapeutic advances. Diagnostic biomarkers would be clinically meaningful to allow for early detection of the tumorand for those cases in which surgery is contraindicated or biopsy results are inconclusive. Recent findings show that GBM cells release microvesicles that contain a select subset of cellular proteins and RNA. The aim of this hypothesis-generating study was to assess the diagnostic potential of miRNAs found in microvesicles isolated from the serum of GBM patients. Methods. To control disease heterogeneity, we used patients with newly diagnosed GBM. In the discovery stage, PCR-based TaqMan Low Density Arrays followed by individual quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were used to test the differences in the miRNA expression levels of serum microvesicles among 25 GBM patients and healthy controls paired by age and sex. The detected noncoding RNAs were then validated in another 50 GBM patients. Results. We found that the expression levels of 1 small noncoding RNA (RNU6-1) and 2 microRNAs (miR-320 and miR-574-3p) were significantly associated with a GBM diagnosis.

Vitamin D has immunosuppressive properties; as does glioma. It was, therefore, our hypothesis that elevated vitamin D concentration would increase glioma risk. We conducted a nested case-control study using specimens from the Janus Serum Bank cohort in Norway. Blood donors who were subsequently diagnosed with glioma (n = 592), between 1974 and 2007, were matched to donors without glioma (n = 1112) on date and age at blood collection and sex.

However, the  exact role of circulating miR-182 in glioma remains unclear. Here, we confirmed the expression of plasma circulating miR-182 in glioma patients, and further explored its potential diagnostic and prognostic value.Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) was used to measure circulating cell-free miR-182 from 112 glioma patients and 54 healthy controls.Our findings showed that the level of circulating miR-182 in glioma patients was higher than that in healthy  controls (P<0.001), which was significantly associated with KPS score (P=0.025) and WHO grade (P<0.001).

Galectin-1, a glycan-binding protein that is overexpressed in HGG, has been shown to contribute signiﬁcantly to the aggressive nature of HGG. It is unknown whether increased galectin-1 expression levels are exclusively found at the tumor site or whether galectin-1 can also be detected in the serum of HGG patients. Galectin-1 serum levels were analyzed in a prospective dataset of 43 healthy controls and 125 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HGG. Samples were taken at the moment of surgical resection and/or 2-3 weeks after surgery. Galectin-1 serum levels were determined using an ELISA for galectin-1. Galectin-1 serum levels depended signiﬁcantly on age and sex in the control group. Age- and sex-adjusted galectin-1 serum levels were signiﬁcantly higher in all patient subgroups compared to healthy controls with a high discriminative ability that increased with age. We did not observe a signiﬁcant decrease in the galectin-1 serum levels upon surgical resection of the tumor. Collectively, the data presented here may represent a ﬁrst step to establish galectin-1 as a biomarker in HGG disease monitoring. Further longitudinal evaluation is required and ongoing to investigate the value of galectin-1 serum levels in HGG patients as an additional diagnostic marker, but more importantly as a predictor of treatment response and prognosis.

However, it may be misinterpreted as other high-grade brain tumors due to the presence of large tumor cells with conspicuous pleomorphism and occasional atypical features, such as tumor necrosis and endothelial proliferation. In this study, we first investigated thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression in a large series of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and other histologic and locational mimics to validate the diagnostic utility of this marker. We then examined TTF-1 expression in non-neoplastic brain tissue to determine the cell origin of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Twenty-four subependymal giant cell astrocytoma specimens were subjected to tissue microarray construction. For comparison, a selection of tumors, including histologic mimics (21 gemistocytic astrocytomas and 24 gangliogliomas), tumors predominantly occurring at the ventricular system (50 ependymomas, 19 neurocytomas, and 7 subependymomas), and 134 astrocytomas (3 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, 45 diffuse astrocytomas, 46 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 40 glioblastomas) were used. Immunohistochemical stain for TTF-1 was positive in all 24 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, whereas negative in all astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, ependymomas, and subependymomas. Neurocytomas were positive for TTF-1 in 4/19 (21%) of cases using clone 8G7G3/1 and in 9/19 (47%) of cases using clone SPT24. In the three fetal brains that we examined, TTF-1 expression was seen in the medial ganglionic eminence, a transient fetal structure between the caudate nucleus and the thalami. There was no BRAFV600E mutation identified by direct sequencing in the 20 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas that we studied. In conclusion, TTF-1 is a useful marker in distinguishing subependymal giant cell astrocytoma from its mimics.

This contrasts with the biologically distinct pilocytic astrocytoma, which is circumscribed, often cystic, slowly proliferating, and associated with a favorable long-term outcome. Diagnostic markers for distinguishing pilocytic astrocytomas from infiltrating anaplastic astrocytomas are currently not available. To identify genes that might either serve as markers or explain these distinct biologic behaviors, cDNA microarray analysis was used to compare the expression of 7,073 genes (nearly one quarter of the human genome) between these 2 types of astrocytoma. Messenger RNAs pooled from 3 pilocytic astrocytomas and from 4 infiltrating anaplastic astrocytomas were compared.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of human brain tumor. It was previously shown that high levels of laminin-8 expression were a predictor of tumor recurrence and patient survival. It is thus important to elucidate the mechanism by which laminin-8 expression is regulated and determine how this contributes to glioma progression. This study investigated the mechanism of regulation of LAMB1, which encodes the b1 chain of laminin-8, in glioma cells lines and in a mouse model of GBM.  Methods. The expression levels of LAMB1 and miR-124-5p were examined in glioma cell lines (U87 and U251) and GBM tissue samples by quantitative PCR and Western blotting. The potential regulation of LAMB1 by miR-124-5p was investigated by assessing the effects of restored miR-124-5p expression on cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth and angiogenesis. The effects of inhibiting LAMB1 on tumor growth and angiogenesis were also assessed.  Results. The upregulation of LAMB1 expression was highly correlated with the downregulation of miR-124-5p. LAMB1 protein expression was suppressed by miR-124-5p. The restoration of miR-124-5p expression suppressed glioma growth by inhibiting angiogenesis, effects that were also observed upon LAMB1 knockdown.  Conclusions.

Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are thought to be responsible for the recurrence, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis of glioblastoma. Fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7), which is a cellular chaperone for a variety of omega-3 fatty acids, is a known marker for neural stem cells. In this study, using a newly developed anti-FABP7 antibody and patient-derived GSC lines, we evaluated the expression of FABP7 in GSCs. Using immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and qPCR analyses, FABP7 was found to be highly enriched in GSCs and its localization was found in cytosol and nuclei. FABP7 expression was significantly downregulated in differentiated GSCs induced by the addition of serum. In the glioma surgical specimens, FABP7 was highly expressed in the majority of glioblastoma. Double immunostaining for FABP7 and Sox2 showed that FABP7+Sox2+ tumor cells were significantly increased in glioblastoma (grade IV) compared with diffuse astrocytoma (grade II) and anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III).

However, the clinical significance of sPD-L1 in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with glioma remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to detect the correlations of sPD-L1 with clinical features in brain tumors and assess the diagnostic value of this protein in gliomas. Methods: Serum samples were obtained from 73 patients with glioma, 20 patients with meningioma, and 49 healthy controls (HCs) in this study. In total, 31 CSF samples were collected from the matched glioma patients, and seven samples were collected from the matched meningioma patients. The expression of serum sPD-L1 in the glioma cohort was followed for 20 days after surgery to examine the kinetics in the circulation. Inflammatory markers were evaluated based on preoperative blood parameters. The sPD-L1 levels in the serum and CSF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The logistic regression model was used to assess the independent associations of sPD-L1 with gliomas, including high-grade gliomas. Results: Serum and CSF levels of sPD-L1 were significantly elevated in patients with gliomas compared to those with meningiomas and HCs. Additionally, increased levels of sPD-L1 were observed in relatively advanced tumors. sPD-L1 overexpression in the CSF appears to be more representative of aggressive tumor features than overexpression in the serum. For glioma diagnosis, both serum and CSF sPD-L1 showed significant value in the diagnosis and stratification of glioma, and the best diagnostic performance was obtained with serum sPD-L1 rather than blood-based inflammatory markers. In addition, a descending trend in the level of serum sPD-L1 was observed in postoperative patients.

Combined loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (denoted as 1p/19q) has proven to be a powerful predictor of chemotherapeutic response and survival in oligodendrogliomas. We undertook retrospective and prospective studies of brain tumor patients originally diagnosed as oligodendrogliomas or oligoastrocytomas patients followed at our institution using molecular genetic techniques. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes specific for chromosomes 1 and 19 was performed on 22 paraffin-embedded tissues retrospectively; 15 touch-preparation smear samples were studied prospectively; and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) screening was performed on 11 samples with microsatellite markers specific to chromosome 1 and chromosome 19. Of the 37 cases, 24 had 1p/19q, 1 case had 1p only, 2 cases had 19q only, and 10 cases had no deletion. The length of the largest deletion was mapped between markers D1S2795 (1p36.31 locus) and D1S2722 (1p34.2 locus) and between markers D19S416 (19q13.11 locus) and D19S397 (19q13.14 locus), using LOH.

We  set out to further clarify the diagnostic and prognostic  implications of these alterations in a broader set of  diffuse gliomas, including astrocytic neoplasms and  low-grade oligodendrogliomas.  Patients and Methods: Fluorescence in situ hybrid ization (FISH) signals from DNA probes mapping to 1p  and 19q common deletion regions were enumerated in  162 diffuse gliomas (79 astrocytomas, 52 oligodendro gliomas, and 31 mixed oligoastrocytomas), collected as  part of an ongoing prospective investigation of CNS  tumors.  Results: The oligodendroglial phenotype was highly  associated with loss of 1p (P 5 .0002), loss of 19q (P <  .0001), and combined loss of 1p and 19q (P < .0001).

However, markers currently available are not sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used as actual diagnostic tools. Differentiation between the malignant and benign lesions of the CNS is very important, both for determining the optimum therapeutic approach and to predict morbidity and mortality of the disease. Accurate diagnosis of a malignant disease is mostly performed through a surgical resection and histopathologic evaluation. Free oxygen radicals (FOR) are thought to take part in oncogenesis and cellular differentiation. We explored whether FORs can be used as diagnostic tumor markers.

Downregulation of miR-383 enhanced, whereas upregulation of miR-383 inhibited, the glioma cell invasive ability. Furthermore, we found that downregulation of miR-383 activated the AKT signaling following upregulation of MMP2 expression by directly targeting insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). Importantly, we demonstrated that IGF1R expression is critical for miR-383 downregulation-induced cell invasion. Taken together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism for constitutive IGF1R signaling activation in glioma cancer and may provide miR-383 as a useful diagnostic marker or therapeutic target.",miR-383; Glioma; Invasion; IGF1R,MIR383,miR-383,"Taken together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism for constitutive IGF1R signaling activation in glioma cancer and may provide miR-383 as a useful diagnostic marker or therapeutic target.",RNA Biomarker,miRNA,"Diagnositic,Therapeutic","Tier 3, Biomarker is validated in pre-clinical research",China,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"II,IV",Tissue,qRT-PCR,NA,IGF1R; MMP2,1. miR-383 is downregulated in human glioma tissues and cell lines; 2.

However, DNA methylation of human subtelomeres and their correlation to telomere length (TL) remain undetermined in glioma. Results： Herein, we report on the selective changes in subtelomeric DNA methylation at the end of five  chromosomes (Chr.) (7q, 8q. 18p, 21q, and XpYp) and ascertain their correlation with TL in patients with glioma. Subtelomeric methylation level was invariably higher in glioma patients compared to the control group, irrespective of their age and tumor grade. In particular, a significant increase in methylation was observed at the subtelomericCpG sites of Chr. 8q, 21q, and XpYp in tissues, obtained from the brain tumor of glioma patients. In contrast, no  significant change in methylation was observed at the subtelomere of Chr. 7q and 18p. Selective changes in the subtelomeric methylation level, however, did not show any significant correlation to the global TL. This observedphenomenon was validated in vitro by inducing demethylation in a glioblastoma cell line (SF-767) using 5-azacytidine/ (AZA) treatment. AZA treatment caused significant changes in the subtelomeric methylation pattern but did not alter the TL, which supports our hypothesis. Conclusions： DNA methylation level dramatically increased at the subtelomere of Chr.8q, 21q, and XpYp in malignant   glioma, which could be used as an early epigenetic diagnostic biomarker of the disease.

Recurrent mutations in the isocitrate dehydro genase 1 (IDH1) andIDH2genes, which are frequent in gliomas, result in marked accumulation of the metabolic by-product 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) within tumors. In other malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia, presence of IDH mutation is associated with elevated 2-HG levels in serum or urine com partments. Circulating 2-HG in patients with glial malignancies has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods. In this study, we analyzed 2-HG levels in the serum and urine of a large set of patients with IDH-mutant and IDH wild-type glioma, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a subset of this cohort. Results. We found that 2-HG was elevated in the urine of patients with IDH-mutant versusIDH-wild-type glioma, although no significant differences in 2-HG levels were observed in the serum or the small set of CSF samples obtained.

Here we describe a multi-institutional study  of RNA extracted from CSF-derived EVs of GBM patients, for the presence of tumor-associated  amplifications and mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  Methods: CSF and matching tumor tissue were obtained from patients undergoing resection of  GBMs. We determined wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR) DNA copy number amplification, as well as  wtEGFR and EGFRvIII RNA expression, in tumor samples. We also characterized wtEGFR and  EGFRvIII RNA expression in CSF-derived EVs.  Results: EGFRvIII positive tumors had significantly greater wtEGFR DNA amplification (p=0·02)  and RNA expression (p=0·03), and EGFRvIII positive CSF-derived EVs had significantly more  wtEGFR RNA expression (p=0·004). EGFRvIII was detected in CSF-derived EVs for 14 of the  23 EGFRvIII tissue-positive GBM patients.

However the possible involvement of TFAM in cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we have provided some evidence that TFAM may have a potential role in brain tumor. Western blot analysis with anti-TFAM antibody indicated that TFAM is overexpressed in glioblastoma cell lines including U87MG and U251MG. Transcriptome profiling of U87MG and U251MG cells by using deep-sequencing revealed that TFAM transcripts were upregulated in these cells compared to its of cerebral cortex. Confocal microscopic analysis of U251MG cells with anti-TFAM antibody showed that TFAM is located to the dot-like structure close to nucleus, probably mitochondria and endosome. Immunohistochemical analysis of glioma tissue specimens indicated that TFAM is highly upregulated. Bioinformatical analysis with Rembrandt knowledgebase also supported that TFAM mRNA is upregu lated in glioma patients.

Plant  homeodomain fnger protein 20 (PHF20) is highly expressed in primary human gliomas and its expression is associated with tumor grade. However, the molecular mechanism by which PHF20 regulates glioblastoma remains poorly  understood. Methods: Genome wide gene expression analysis was performed to identify diferentially expressed genes (DEGs)  in U87 cells with PHF20 gene knockdown. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to  investigate the functions and pathways of DEGs. Pathway-net and signal-net analyses were conducted to identify the  key genes and pathways related to PHF20. Results: Expression of 540 genes, including FEN1 and CCL3, were signifcantly altered upon PHF20 gene silencing.  GO analysis results showed that DEGs were signifcantly enriched in small molecule metabolic and apoptotic processes.

Our aim was to further elucidate the role of WT1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in neuropathology, particularly as to the differentiation of astrocytoma from oligodendroglioma as well as to the dependency of WT1 expression on clinically relevant parameters. Methods 829 evaluable brain tumour samples were investigated by WT1 immunohistochemistry on full tissue routine slides, consisting of 442 glioblastomas, 303 astrocytomas, 41 oligodendrogliomas and 43 oligoastrocytomas. In addition public WT1 gene expression data of 351 gliomas were analysed. Results Our data show that WT1 expression in diffuse astrocytic tumours increases with WHO tumour grade and is associated with older age, absence of IDH1 mutation but not related to O(6)- methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Univariable, but not multivariable survival analysis indicates that WT1 expression is associated with worse outcome in patients with diffuse astrocytoma but not glioblastoma.

VEGF is a highly specific endothelial cell activator that induces angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Our study was designed to assess whether VEGF could be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with cerebral neoplasms and used as a marker of particular tumors. We also studied serum recoverin levels in patients with various brain tumors and compared these to controls. Recoverin is a detectable serologic protein that is expressed in patients with cancer-associated retinopathy, a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Methods: In the VEGF arm, we used a solid-phase ELISA to determine the levels of VEGF. CSF samples from patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and with metastatic and nonastrocytic brain tumors were compared with nontumor control samples. In our recoverin study, an immunoenzymetric assay was used to measure the serum recoverin levels patients with glioma and compared with controls.  Results: In the VEGF arm, 89% of samples with malignant astrocytoma and 27% of nonastrocytoma samples had detectable levels of VEGF. VEGF was not detectable in normal CSF samples. The levels of VEGF were significantly higher in high-grade astrocytomas than in nonastrocytic tumors. Recoverin levels were 10-fold higher in patients with recurrent GBM relative to controls. In patients with low-grade glioma, anaplastic glioma, and GBM with no evidence of recurrence, a 3- to 5-fold increase was observed.

The miRNA microarray reveals differentially expressed miRNAs in serum between the GBM and normal controls. Of the 752 miRNAs, 115 miRNAs were upregulated in the GBM group, and 24 miRNAs were downregulated (fold change 2.0, P<0.01).

Here, we investigated whether the upregulation of the NLRC4 infammasome is associated with the clinical prognosis of gliomas. We analyzed the protein expression and localization of NLRC4 in glioma tissues from 11 patients by immunohistochemistry. We examined the interaction between the expression of NLRC4 and clinical prognosis via a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The level of NLRC4 protein was increased in brain tissues, specifcally, in astrocytes, from glioma patients.

To date, the relationship  between GATAD1 amplification and glioma oncogenesis and malignancy is still  unknown. Methods: GATAD1 gene amplification and expression were analyzed in 187 gliomas using qPCR and immunostaining. The relation of GATAD1 to patients' prognoses was assessed via the Kaplan-Meier method. The MTT and orthotopic tumor  transplantation assays were used to identify the function of GATAD1 in glioma proliferation. cDNA microarray, ChIP qPCR, EMSA and 3C were used to screen the  downstream mechanism of GATAD1 regulating glioma proliferation. Results: Our results indicated that GATAD1 gene amplification and GATAD1 gene  expression are novel independent diagnosis biomarkers to indicate poor outcome of  glioma patients.

More reliable, sensitive and practical biomarkers to reveal glioma high invasiveness remain to be explored for the guidance of therapy. We herein evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) in the glioma specimens from  237 patients, and found that ADLH1A1 was frequently overexpressed in the high-grade glioma (WHO grade III-IV) as compared to the low-grade glioma (WHO grade I-II) patients. The tumor cells with ALDH1A1 expression were more abundant in the region between tumor and the borderline of adjacent tissue as compared to the central part of the tumor. ALDH1A1 overexpression was associated with poor differentiation and dismal prognosis.

Therefore, exosomal miRNAs as novel non-invasive biomarkers having high sensitivity and specificity are required to improve diagnosis and to develop new targeted therapy strategies for GBM patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate a novel miRNA signature asa predictive biomarker for diagnosis and measurement of response to therapeutic interventions in plasma of GBM patients versus traumatic brain injury and diffuse low-grade astrocytoma(LGA) patients.  Patients and methods: Plasma exosomal-microRNAs were isolated from GBM(n=25),LGA(n=25), and head trauma patients (n=15)as non-glioma control from March 2017 to June 2018 in Department of Neurosurgery at Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital. Through a bioinformatics analysis, we used Miranda, Target Scan, mirBase, DIANA-microT-CDS, and KEGG database as well asmicroarray data analysis from GEO for microRNA candidates. Finally, miR-210, miR-185, miR-5194, and miR-449 were selected among those miRNAs because they were recorded to target the maximum number of genes in EGFR and c-MET signaling pathways. Then, exosomal microRNAs were extracted from plasma of patients and quantitated by locked nucleic acid real-time PCR in GBM, LGA, and trauma patients.  Results: This result is the first report on the role of circulating miR-185, miR-449, and miR-5194 in GBM compared to LGA and trauma. The plasma expression of miR-210 as an oncogenic miR was upregulated in GBM and LGA groups (P< 0.0001). Otherwise, miR-185, miR-5194, and miR-449 were significantly downregulated(P0.05) in GBM and LGA compared to trauma patients.

Moreover, the  upregulated miR-93 level was  significantly associated with the advanced malignancy. We also  found that upregulation of miR-93 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells, and that miR.93 was  involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression by mediating the  protein levels of P21, P27, P53 and Cyclin D1. P21 was further  identified as a direct target of miR-93. Knockdown of P21 attenuated the suppressive effects of miR-93 inhibition on cell cycle progression and colony formation. In addition, inhibition of miR-93 enhanced the chemosensitization of glioma cells to temozolomide (TMZ). Based on  these above data, our study demonstrates that miR-93, upregulated in  glioma, promotes the proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration  and invasionof human glioma cells and suppresses their chemosensitivity to TMZ. Therefore, miR-93 may  become a  promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target tor glioma.",Glioma; MicroRNA; Proliferation; Invasion; Cellcycle; Temozolomide,MIR93,miR-93 ,MiR-93 may  become a  promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for glioma.,RNA Biomarker,miRNA,"Diagnositic,Therapeutic","Tier 3, Biomarker is validated in pre-clinical research",China,43,27,16,NA,NA,"I,II,III,IV",Tissue,"In situ hybridisation,qRT-PCR",NA,NA,1.

Several  studies have proved a greater reliability of MCM proteins to  stain proliferating cells compared to Ki67 protein, a routinely  used proliferation marker in histopathology. In the present  study, the expressions of MCM7 and Ki67 were estimated in  66 primary human astrocytomas in relation to tumor grade  (Grade I-IV, WHO). MCM7 significantly stained more nuclei  compared to Ki67 in all the histopathological grades  investigated. In addition, a stronger increase of the MCM7  labelling index, in relation to the tumor aggressiveness, was  observed.  Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins represent  a protein family, MCM2 to MCM7, which forms  heterohexameric complexes at the replication origin during  eukaryotic DNA duplication, licensing DNA replication  (1). This makes MCM proteins attractive as histological  markers (2), supported by increasing evidence of a better  correlation between MCM7 expression and proliferating  cells compared to Ki67 in many tumors (3-8).  Astrocytic tumors comprise a wide range of  neuroectodermal tumors that differ in growth potential,  extent of invasiveness, morphological features, tendency for  progression and clinical outcome (9).

Paraffin-embedded sections of intracerebral gliomas (n = 48), consisting of diffuse astrocytoma (n = 9), anaplastic astrocytoma(n = 8) and glioblastoma (n = 31), were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using markers of cell cycle entry, Mcm-2 and Ki67, and putative markers of cell cycle phase, cyclins D1 (G1-phase), cyclin A (S-phase), cyclin B1 (G2-phase) and phosphodiester H3 (Mitosis). Double labelling confocal microscopy confirmed that the phase markers were infrequently expressed. Cell cycle estimations by immunohistochemistry were corroborated by flow cytometric analysis. There was a significant increase in Mcm-2 (P < 0.0001), Ki67 (P < 0.0001), cyclin A (P < 0.0001)and cyclin B1 (P = 0.002) expression with increasing grade from diffuse astrocytoma through anaplastic astrocytoma to glioblastoma, suggesting that any of these four markers has potential as a marker of tumor grade. In a subset of glioblastomas (n = 16) for which accurate clinical follow-up data were available, there was a suggestion that the cyclin A:Mcm-2 labelling fraction might predict relatively favorable response to radical radiotherapy. These provisional findings, however, require confirmation by a larger study. We conclude that it is feasible to obtain detailed cell cycle data by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue biopsies.

However, the prognosis of the disease remains poor. Explorations of the underlying mechanisms of glioma and identification of effective markers for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication remain important today. In this study, we employed survival analysis to determine that TPM3 overexpression was significantly associated with high-grade gliomas and higher mortality. Using microarray combined with Pearson correlation analysis, we found that TPM3 was positively correlated with the expression of MMP family members and EMT-like activators. Reduction of TPM3 (via TPM3-siRNA) inhibited cellular invasion and migration and decreased MMP-9 and SNAI1 levels in glioma cells. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show that TPM3 plays a critical role in the progression of gliomas and provides novel insights into the key roles of MMP family members and EMT-like activators that mediate TPM3 functional signaling for glioma regulation.

If the degree of malignancy of brain tumors can be evaluated by MET-PET, the usefulness of MET-PET as a means of diagnosing brain tumors will increase. Methods: We performed this study on 67 glioma patients between 3 and 69 years of age (36 males and 31 females). Tumors included diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, ependymoma, oligodendroglioma, medulloblastoma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, choroid plexus papilloma, central neurocytoma, optic glioma, gliomatosis cerebri, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, and ganglioglioma. Tumor activity and degree of malignancy were evaluated using Ki-67LI (LI: labeling index) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The correlations between methionine uptake and tumor proliferation (tumor versus contralateral gray matter ratio (T/N) and Ki-67LI) were determined for the group of all subjects. The existence of significant correlations between T/N and Ki-67LI and between SUV and Ki-67LI was determined for astrocytic tumors. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of T/N and standardized uptake value (SUV) was performed for the group of astrocytic tumors. We also determined the ROC cut-off levels to ensure high accuracy of the analysis. Results: For the 67 cases of glioma, the degree of accumulation was variable.

However, the diagnostic criteria, in particular for oligoastrocytoma, are highly subjective.

TFPI-2 expression was absent in five of nine investigated high-grade glioma cell lines. Lentiviral knockdown of TFPI-2 in two of the TFPI-2-expressing cell lines (MZ-18 and Hs 638) was associated with pronounced changes in the cellular behavior: glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly increased in TFPI-2 knockdown cells in comparison to empty vector-transfected control cells. Since TFPI-2 might exert its tumor suppressor function by inhibiting MMPs, we subsequently analyzed the effects of specific MMP inhibitors on cell invasion of TFPI-2 KD cells vs. control cells.

It is not only a brain-specific gene but also a novel candidate for tumor suppression. LRRC4 inactivation is commonly found in glioma cell lines and primary glioma biopsies. However, little is known about the mechanism controlling LRRC4 expression. In a previous study, we did not find any genetic alteration in LRRC4 in primary glioma, which led us to explore an alternative mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Methods: In the present paper, we cloned the LRRC4 promoter with characteristics of a CpG island by luciferase reporter assay. Then, the CpG methylation status around the LRRC4 promoter region in glioma cell lines and primary gliomas was examined by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite DNA sequencing. In order to demonstrate a functional association between LRRC4 promoter methylation and its gene inactivation, we performed DNA demethylation analysis with two human glioma cell lines using methylation-specific PCR and RT-PCR. Results: The sequence spanning positions -835 to -293 relative to the translation start site was identified as the LRRC4 promoter; this sequence is a TATA- and CAAT- less, high GC content region. It was found that LRRC4 promoter activity is strongly suppressed after treatment with SssI methylase in vitro. Furthermore, LRRC4 promoter methylation was observed by methylationspecific PCR in two glioma cell lines and all 30 primary glioma specimens, but not in normal brain tissue. Bisulfite DNA sequencing showed that most of the CpG sites were located around the LRRC4 promoter methylated in glioma cells and tissues, but not in normal brain tissue.

Ferroptosis is a newly recognized type of cell death, which may be associated with low-grade glioma border detection and OS. This study is assessed an optimized ferroptosis gene panel for glioma treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS We obtained 45 reports on ferroptosis-related proteins in PubMed and conducted a statistical test of the patients' overall survival (OS) in the TCGA GBMLGG and CGGA databases. The statistically significant genes were screened for an optimal panel, followed by GO and KEGG analysis and evaluated its correlation with known prognostic factors of glioma, including IDH1 mutation, methylated MGMT, tumor purity, 1p/19q LOH, and methionine cycle.

Although a large number of glioma studies powered by high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to massive multi-omics datasets, there lacks of comprehensive integration of glioma datasets for uncovering candidate biomarker genes. Results: In this study, we collected a large-scale assemble of multi-omics multi-cohort datasets from worldwide public resources, involving a total of 16,939 samples across 19 independent studies. Through comprehensive molecular profiling across different datasets, we revealed that PRKCG (Protein Kinase C Gamma), a brain-specific gene detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, is closely associated with glioma. Specifically, it presents lower expression and higher methylation in glioma samples compared with normal samples. PRKCG expression/methylation change from high to low is indicative of glioma progression from low-grade to high-grade and high RNA expression is suggestive of good survival. Importantly, PRKCG in combination with MGMT is effective to predict survival outcomes in a more precise manner. Conclusions: PRKCG bears the great potential for glioma diagnosis, prognosis and therapy, and PRKCG-like genes may represent a set of important genes associated with different molecular mechanisms in glioma tumorigenesis.

C ell and molecular biology techniques were applied for investigating the role of TPTeP1 in glioma cell lines, animal model, and clinical samples. The results demonstrated that TPT eP1 attenuated stemness and radioresistance of glioma both in vitro and in vivo. in addition, TPT eP1 augmented M A PK14 expression by competitively interacting with microrna (mi r) -106a-5p, thus activating the P38 M A PK signaling pathway, and suppressing glioma stemness and radioresistance. TPTeP1 functionally bound to mi r-106a-5p, which formed a reciprocal regulatory loop to stimulate the P38 M A PK signaling pathway.

Accumulating evidence implies that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in predicting survival for glioma patients. However, the potential function of lncRNA ELF3-antisense RNA 1 (ELF3-AS1) in tumors remained largely unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the expression of lncRNA ELF3-antisense RNA 1 (ELF3-AS1) and evaluate its functions in glioma patients. Patients and Methods. ELF3-AS1 expressions were examined by RT-PCR in 182 pairs of glioma specimens and adjacent normal tissues. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to estimate the diagnostic value of ELF3-AS1. The chi-square tests were used to examine the associations between ELF3-AS1 expression and the clinicopathological characters. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed by log-rank test, and survival curves were plotted according to Kaplan-Meier. The prognostic value of the ELF3-AS1 expression in glioma patients was further analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss-of-function assays were performed to determine the potential function of ELF3-AS1 on the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. Results. The ELF3-AS1 expression level was signiﬁcantly higher in glioma specimens compared with adjacent nontumor specimens (p < 0:01). A high expression of ELF3-AS1 was shown to be associated with the WHO grade (p = 0:023) and KPS score (p = 0:012). ROC assays revealed that high ELF3-AS1 expression had an AUC value of 0.8073 (95% CI: 0.7610 to 0.8535) for glioma. Using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that patients with a high ELF3-AS1 expression had signiﬁcantly poor OS (p = 0:006) and DFS (p = 0:0002). In a multivariate Cox model, we conﬁrmed that ELF3-AS1 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that knockdown of ELF3-AS1 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. Conclusions.

However, the discovery of novel oncogenes and the study of its molecular regulating mechanism based on circular RNAs (circRNAs) may provide a promising treatment target in glioma. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis, qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression levels of ISL2, miR-342-3p, circRNA ARF1 (cARF1), U2AF2, and VEGFA. Patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) were established for the molecular experiments. Lentiviral-based infection was used to regulate the expression of these molecules in GSCs. The MTS, EDU, Transwell, and tube formation assays were used to detect the proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis of human brain microvessel endothelial cells (hBMECs). RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, dual-luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to detect the direct regulation mechanisms among these molecules. Results: We first identified a novel transcription factor related to neural development. ISL2 was overexpressed in glioma and correlated with poor patient survival. ISL2 transcriptionally regulated VEGFA expression in GSCs and promoted the proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis of hBMECs via VEGFA-mediated ERK signaling. Regarding its mechanism of action, cARF1 upregulated ISL2 expression in GSCs via miR-342-3p sponging. Furthermore, U2AF2 bound to and promoted the stability and expression of cARF1, while ISL2 induced the expression of U2AF2, which formed a feedback loop in GSCs. We also showed that both U2AF2 and cARF1 had an oncogenic effect, were overexpressed in glioma, and correlated with poor patient survival. Conclusions: Our study identified a novel feedback loop among U2AF2, cARF1, miR-342-3p, and ISL2 in GSCs. This feedback loop promoted glioma angiogenesis, and could provide an effective biomarker for glioma diagnosis and prognostic evaluation, as well as possibly being used for targeted therapy.","Glioma stem cells; Angiogenesis; ISL2, circRNA ARF1; U2AF2; miR-342-3p",ISL2,ISL2,"Our study identified a novel feedback loop among U2AF2, cARF1, miR-342-3p, and ISL2 in GSCs.

Here we intended to assess the regulatory function of miR-351 on nuclear apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (NAIF1) and, thereby, modulation of cancerous behaviors of human glioma cell lines. Two human glioma cell lines (U87 and U251) and normal human astroglia (NHA) cell line were cultured. The cell lines were prepared and transfected with mimic, inhibitor, and negative controls (NCs) of miR-351, then MTT and wound healing assays were performed. We extracted the total protein for western blotting assay and isolated the total RNA for real-time PCR. The miR-351 expression was significantly decreased in U87 and U251 cell lines compared with the NHA cell line (P < 0.05). NAIF1 expression was significantly higher in glioma cell lines compared with the NHA cell line (P < 0.05). Moreover, the NAIF1 expression showed a negative correlation with miR-351 (P = 0.005, r = −0.522). Apoptosis was significantly decreased in both cell lines transfected with miR-351 mimics compared with the NC group at 72 and 96 h after transfection (P < 0.05) and significantly increased in the transfected group with miR-351 inhibitors compared with the NC group at 72 and 96 h after transfection (P < 0.05).

The prognosis of patients with high-grade glioma is poor. It is therefore crucial to develop effective therapeutic strategies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported as potential inducers or suppressors of tumor progression. Previous studies have indicated that the lncRNA Feline Leukemia Virus Subgroup C Cellular Receptor 1 Antisense RNA 1 (FLVCR1-AS1) is involved in the development and progression of gastric and lung cancer, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma; however, the biological effect of FLVCR1-AS1 in glioma is not completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate how FLVCR1-AS1 modulates cell proliferation and invasion in glioma. FLVCR1-AS1 expression was significantly upregulated in GBM tissues compared with adjacent normal brain samples, and was higher in GBM cell lines compared with normal human astrocyte cells. Furthermore, the microRNA (miR)-30b-3p was revealed to be a putative target of FLVCR1-AS1, and the suppressive effects of miR-30b-3p on cellular proliferation and invasion were reversed following FLVCR1-AS1-knockdown. The results from Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell assays confirmed that FLVCR1-AS1-knockdown inhibited GBM cell proliferation and invasion ability. In addition, FLVCR1-AS1 was found to directly interact with miR-30b-3p, and a rescue experiment further established that FLVCR1-AS1 contributed to glioma progression by inhibiting miR-30b-3p. The results from the present study demonstrated that FLVCR1-AS1 may serve an oncogenic role in GBM and promote disease progression by interacting with miR-30b-3p.

In the present study, we aimed to screen microRNA (miRNA) markers in serum exosomes for diﬀerential diagnosis of high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma using high-throughput sequencing technology. Methods. Patients with intracranial lymphoma or high-grade glioma and healthy controls were included in this study (training cohort (n = 10) and validation cohort: intracranial lymphoma (n = 10), high-grade glioma (n = 32), and healthy controls (n = 20)). After RNA was extracted from serum exosomes, the high-throughput sequencing was used to determine the expression proﬁles of serum exosomal miRNAs and screen the diﬀerentially expressed miRNAs. RT-qPCR was used to verify the expressions of the selected miRNAs. The diﬀerences of miRNA expressions between groups were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The diagnostic value was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that 170 miRNAs, including 109 upregulated ones and 61 downregulated ones, were diﬀerentially expressed in serum exosomes between the patients with intracranial lymphoma and high-grade glioma. Compared with the healthy controls, the number of diﬀerential serum exosomal miRNAs in the high-grade glioma group and intracranial lymphoma group was 130 and 173, respectively. RT-qPCR proved that both miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p were signiﬁcantly downregulated in high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma patients compared with the healthy controls (all p < 0:001), and the expression of serum exosomal miR-766-5p in the intracranial lymphoma group was lower compared with the high-grade glioma group (p < 0:05).

The expressions of ZNF667-AS1 were detected in 155 glioma tissues and matched normal brain tissue samples by qRT-PCR. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to estimate the diagnostic value of ZNF667-AS1.

In previous studies, it has shown excellent specificity but limited sensitivity for IDH-mut astrocytomas. Whether the mismatch sign is a marker of a clinically relevant subtype of IDH-mut astrocytomas is unknown. Methods: We included histopathologically verified supratentorial lower-grade gliomas (LGG) WHO grade II-III retrospectively during the period 2010-2016. In the period 2017-2018, patients with suspected LGG radiologically were prospectively included, and in this cohort other diagnoses than glioma could occur. Clinical, radiological and molecular data were collected. For clinical evaluation we included all patients with IDH-mut astrocytomas.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and angiogenesis play important roles in glioma growth, invasion, and recurrence. The present study aimed to use proteomic methods to probe into the role of the EGF-EGFR-angiogenesis axis in the tumorigenesis of glioma and access the therapeutic efficacy of selumetinib on glioma. Methods: Proteomic profiling was used to characterize 200 paired EGFRpositive and EGFR-negative glioma tissues of all pathological types. The quantitative mass spectrometry data were used for systematic analysis of the proteomic profiles of 10 EGFR-positive and 10 EGFR-negative glioma cases. Consensusclustering analysis was used to screen target proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis, cell growth assay, and intracranial xenograft experiments were used to verify and test the therapeutic effect of selumetinib on glioma. Results: Advanced proteomic screening demonstrated that the expression of EGF-like domain multiple 7 (EGFL7) was higher in EGFR-positive tumor tissues than in EGFR-negative tumor tissues. In addition, EGFL7 could act as an activator in vitro and in vivo to promote glioma cell proliferation. EGFL7 was associated strongly with EGFR and prognosis. EGFL7 knockdown effectively suppressed glioma cell proliferation. Selumetinib treatment showed tumor reduction effect in EGFR-positive glioblastoma xenograft mouse model.

High-grade glioma is the most pervasive and lethal of all brain malignancies. Despite advances in imaging technologies, discriminating between gliomas and other brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) often requires brain biopsy. Several reports show that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor Z (PTPRZ) is highly expressed in glioblastoma, and we found that a soluble cleaved form of PTPRZ (sPTPRZ) was present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The aim of this study was to determine whether the sPTPRZ level in CSF has utility as a diagnostic marker for glioma. Methods. Microarray datasets from normal brain tissue and brain tumors were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. PTPRZ protein expression in clinical specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Semiquantitative western blotting was used to measure sPTPRZ levels in CSF samples from patients with glioma, schwannoma, MS, or nontumor disorders. Results. Expression of PTPRZ mRNA and protein was markedly increased in glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and schwannoma tissues compared with control brain tissue. sPTPRZ was present at significantly elevated levels in the CSF of patients with glioma (grades 1-4), but not in patients with schwannoma or MS, compared with the control samples.

However, the significance of soluble CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) remains unclear in the patients with brain glioma. Here we aimed to investigate the significance of serum sCTLA-4 levels as a noninvasive biomarker for diagnosis and evaluation of the prognosis in glioma patients. Methods: In this study, the levels of sCTLA-4 in serum from 50 patients diagnosed with different grade gliomas including preoperative and postoperative, and 50 healthy individuals were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). And then ROC curve analysis and survival analyses were performed to explore the clinical significance of sCTLA-4. Results: Serum sCTLA-4 levels were significantly increased in patients with glioma compared to that of healthy individuals, and which was also positively correlated with the tumor grade. ROC curve analysis showed that the best cutoff value for sCTLA-4 for glioma is 112.1 pg/ml, as well as the sensitivity and specificity with 82.0 and 78.0%, respectively, and a cut-off value of 220.43 pg/ml was best distinguished in patients between low-grade glioma group and high-grade glioma group with sensitivity 73.1% and specificity 79.2%. Survival analysis revealed that the patients with high sCTLA-4 levels (> 189.64 pg/ml) had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those with low sCTLA-4 levels (≤189.64 pg/ml).

We have previously identiﬁed hypotaurine as one of the top-ranked metabolites for differentiating low- and high-grade tumors, and that there is also a strong association between the levels of intratumoral hypotaurine and expression of its biosynthetic enzyme, cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenase (ADO). Using transcription proﬁling, we further uncovered that the ADO/hypotaurine axis targets CCL20 secretion through activating the NF-κB pathway to drive the self-renewal and maintenance of glioma 'cancer stem cells' or glioma cancer stem-like cells. Conversely, abrogating the ADO/hypotaurine axis using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing limited glioblastoma cell proliferation and self-renewal in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in an orthotopical mouse model, indicating that this metabolic pathway is a potential key therapeutic target.

Currently, cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a revolutionary treatment for patients with advanced highly aggressive therapyresistant tumors. However, there is no effective biomarker to reflect the response to immunotherapy in glioma patient so far. So we aim to assess the clinical predictive value of FCER1G in patients with glioma. Methods: The expression level and correlation between clinical prognosis and FER1G levels were analyzed with the data from CGGA, TCGA, and GEO database. Univariate and multivariate cox regression model was built to predict the prognosis of glioma patients with multiple factors. Then the correlation between FCER1G with immune cell infiltration and activation was analyzed. At last, we predict the immunotherapeutic response in both high and low FCER1G expression subgroups. Results: FCER1G was significantly higher in glioma with greater malignancy and predicted poor prognosis. In multivariate analysis, the hazard ratio of FCER1G expression (Low versus High) was 0.66 and 95 % CI is 0.54 to 0.79 (P < 0.001), whereas age (HR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.04-1.52), grade (HR = 2.75, 95 % CI 2.06-3.68), tumor recurrence (HR = 2.17, 95 % CI 1.81-2.62), IDH mutant (HR = 2.46, 95 % CI 1.97-3.01) and chemotherapeutic status (HR = 1.4, 95 % CI 1.20-1.80) are also included. Furthermore, we illustrated that gene FCER1G stratified glioma cases into high and low FCER1G expression subgroups that demonstrated with distinct clinical outcomes and T cell activation.

In this study, we evaluated the practicality of using EDB-FN as a biomarker and therapeutic target for malignant gliomas (MGs), representative intractable diseases involving brain tumors. Methods: The microarray- and sequence-based patient transcriptomic database 'Oncopression' and tissue microarray of MG patient tissue samples were analyzed. EDB-FN data were extracted and evaluated from 23,344 patient samples of 17 types of cancer to assess its effectiveness and selectivity as a molecular target. To strengthen the results of the patient data analysis, the utility of EDB-FN as a molecular marker and target for MG was verified using active EDB-FN-targeting ultrasmall lipidic micellar nanoparticles (~12 nm), which had a high drug-loading capacity and were efficiently internalized by MG cells in vitro and in vivo. Results: Brain tumors had a 1.42-fold cancer-to-normal ratio (p < 0.0001), the second highest among 17 cancers after head and neck cancer. Patient tissue microarray analysis showed that the EDB-FN high-expression group had a 5.5-fold higher risk of progression than the EDB-FN low-expression group (p < 0.03). By labeling docetaxel-containing ultrasmall micelles with a bipodal aptide targeting EDB-FN (termed APT EDB -DSPE-DTX), we generated micelles that could specifically bind to MG cells, leading to superior antitumor efficacy of EDB-FN-targeting nanoparticles compared to nontargeting controls.

Histopathology and neuroimaging are the main modalities used for diagnosis and treatment response monitoring. However, both are expensive and insensitive methods and can cause neurological deterioration. This study aimed to develop a minimally invasive peripheral inflammatory biomarker for diagnosis of glioma, its grade, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status.

Here, we aimed to explore the role of the lncRNA HAS2-AS1 (HAS2 antisense RNA 1) in GBM. GSE103227 was analyzed, and qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression of HAS2-AS1 in GBM. FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) was performed to verify the localization of HAS2-AS1. The interaction between HAS2-AS1 and miR-137 (microRNA-137) was predicted by LncBook and miRcode followed by dual‐luciferase reporter assays, and the relationships among HAS2-AS1, miR-137 and LSD1 (lysine-speciﬁc demethylase 1) were assessed by WB (western blot) and qRT-PCR.

GNG5, which is part of the G-protein family, has been associated with different malignant tumors, though the role of GNG5 in glioma has not been studied. Therefore, we aimed to identify the relationship between GNG5 and glioma prognosis and identify a new biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of gliomas. Methods: We used data on more than a thousand gliomas from multiple databases and clinical data to determine the expression of GNG5 in glioma. Based on clinical data and CGGA database, we identified the correlation between GNG5 and multiple molecular and clinical features and prognosis using various analytical methods. Co-expression analysis and GSEA were performed to detect GNG5-related genes in glioma and possible signaling pathways involved. ESTIMATE, ssGSEA, and TIMER were used to detect the relationship between GNG5 and the immune microenvironment. Functional experiments were performed to explore the function of GNG5 in glioma cells. Results: GNG5 is highly expressed in gliomas, and its expression level is positively correlated with pathological grade, histological type, age, and tumor recurrence and negatively correlated with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, 1p/19 co-deletion, and chemotherapy. Moreover, GNG5 as an independent risk factor was negatively correlated with the overall survival time. GSEA revealed the potential signaling pathways involved in GNG5 function in gliomas, including cell adhesion molecules signaling pathway. The ssGSEA, ESTIMATE, and TIMER based analysis indicated a correlation between GNG5 expression and various immune cells in glioma. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that GNG5 could participate in glioma cell proliferation and migration.

Glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2), as a factor in oxidative stress, plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, its role in GBM has not been well established. The study aimed to investigate the clinical signiﬁcance of GPX2 with GBM prognosis. Methods ‒ Data of GBM and healthy individuals were retrospectively collected from oncomine, cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE), gene expression proﬁling interactive analysis (GEPIA), UALCAN, and Human Protein Atlas. GPX2 mRNA expression was ﬁrst assessed across various cancer types in oncomine and cancer cell lines from CCLE. The mRNA expression of GPX2 was compared between normal and GBM tissues using GEPIA (normal = 207; GBM = 163) and UALCAN (normal = 5; GBM = 156). The GPX2 methylation was analyzed using data from UALCAN (normal = 2; GBM = 140). The prognostic value of GPX2 in GBM was explored in GEPIA and UALCAN using KaplanMeier method.

Exosome can carry circular RNAs (circRNAs) to regulate drug resistance via sponging microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs can control mRNA expression by regulate the interaction with 3'UTR and methylation. Nanog homeobox (NANOG) is an important biomarker for TMZ resistance. Hitherto, it is unknown about the role of exosomal hsa_circ_0072083 (circ_0072083) in TMZ resistance in glioma, and whether it is associated with NANOG via regulating miRNA sponge and methylation. Methods: TMZ-resistant (n = 36) and sensitive (n = 33) patients were recruited. The sensitive cells and constructed resistant cells were cultured and exposed to TMZ. circ_0072083, miR-1252-5p, AlkB homolog H5 (ALKBH5) and NANOG levels were examined via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of TMZ, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were analyzed via Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell assays. The in vivo function was assessed using xenograft model. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) level was analyzed via methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP). Target relationship was investigated via dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Warburg effect was investigated via lactate production, glucose uptake and key enzymes expression.

Methods: GBM tissues and paired non-tumor tissues were collected from 62 GBM patients through biopsy. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of SLC16A1-AS1 and miR-149. Linear regression was used to analyze their correlations. The relationship between SLC16A1-AS1 and miR-149 was assessed by gain and loss of function experiments.

For this purpose, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were performed to analyze the expression of NICD in human GBM tissues, while western blotting and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR experiments were used to analyze the expression of Hes5 in human GBM tissues. A Flag-NICD vector was used to overexpress NICD in U87 cells and compound E and small interfering (si) Notch1 were used to downregulate NICD. Cellular proliferation curves were generated and BrdU assays performed to evaluate the proliferation of U87 cells. The results demonstrated that compared with normal brain tissues, the level of NICD protein in human GBM tissues was upregulated and the protein and mRNA levels of Hes5 were also upregulated in GBM tissues indicating that the Notch1 signaling pathway is activated in GBM.

Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors that arise from glia cells or neural stem cells and rely on accurate diagnosis for prognosis and treatment strategies. GFAP is differentially expressed between glioma subtypes and, therefore, often used as a diagnostic marker. However, GFAP is highly regulated by the process of alternative splicing; many different isoforms have been identified. Differential expression of GFAP isoforms between glioma subtypes suggests that GFAP isoform-specific analyses could benefit diagnostics. In this study we report on the differential expression of a new GFAP isoform between glioma subtypes, GFAPµ. A short GFAP transcript resulting from GFAP exon 2 skipping was detected by RNA sequencing of human glioma.

This study aimed to find out the role of XRCC2 in glioma and reveal in which glioma-specific biological processes is XRCC2 involved based on thousands of glioma samples, thereby, providing a new perspective in the treatment and prognostic evaluation of glioma. Methods: The expression characteristics of XRCC2 in thousands of glioma samples from CGGA and TCGA databases were comprehensively analyzed. Wilcox or Kruskal test was used to analyze the expression pattern of XRCC2 in gliomas with different clinical and molecular features. The effect of XRCC2 on the prognosis of glioma patients was explored by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression.

The tumor initiation, self-renewal, and multi-lineage differentiation abilities of glioma stem cells (GSCs) are responsible for glioma proliferation and recurrence. Although circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in the progression of glioma, the detailed mechanisms remain unknown. Methods: qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and bioinformatic analysis were performed to detect the expression of circATP5B, miR-185-5p, HOXB5, and SRSF1. Patient-derived GSCs were established, and MTS, EDU, neurosphere formation, and limiting dilution assays were used to detect the proliferation of GSCs. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, luciferase reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to detect these molecules' regulation mechanisms. Results: We found circATP5B expression was significantly upregulated in GSCs and promoted the proliferation of GSCs. Mechanistically, circATP5B acted as miR-185-5p sponge to upregulate HOXB5 expression. HOXB5 was overexpressed in glioma and transcriptionally regulated IL6 expression and promoted the proliferation of GSCs via JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Moreover, RNA binding protein SRSF1 could bind to and promote circATP5B expression and regulate the proliferation of GSCs, while HOXB5 also transcriptionally regulated SRSF1 expression. Conclusions: Our study identified the SRSF1/circATP5B/miR-185-5p/HOXB5 feedback loop in GSCs.

Less invasive and more convenient methods for the prediction of the pathological type and gene status are desired. Materials and methods: This study investigates the ability to use conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) features for determining the Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant and 1p/19q-codeletion status, through a retrospective review of information obtained from 189 WHO grade II glioma patients. Diffuse astrocytoma (IDH-mutant), Diffuse astrocytoma (IDH- wildtype) and Oligodendroglioma (IDH-mutant and 1p/19q co-deletion) were included in this cohort. All patients were divided into IDH-mutant group and IDH-wildtype group according to the IDH R132H mutation status. Moreover, all patients were divided into 1p/19q co-deletion group and 1p/19q non-codeletion group according to the 1p and 19q chromosome status. Patients underwent pre-operative CT and MRI scans, followed by operation and histopathological analyses, including immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction analysis for IDH mutants, and fluorescence capillary electrophoresis analysis for the 1p/19q co-deletion. The χ2 test, logistical regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were conducted for statistical analysis. Results: IDH-mutant group patients exhibited a higher calcification frequency (25.2% vs 2.4%, p = 0.006) and lower frequency of T1 enhancement (20.4% vs 38.1%, p = 0.028) comparing patients in IDH-wildtype group, while 1p/19q co-deletion group patients exhibited a higher calcification frequency (46.67% vs 2.6%, p < 0.001) and lower homogenous signal frequency in T2WI (12.0% vs 31.6%, p = 0.014), sharp lesion margins (14.7% vs 43.0%, p = 0.010), T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery mismatch signs (22.7% vs 50.9%, p = 0.001), and subventricular zone involvement (64.0% vs 15.8%, p = 0.021) comparing patients in 1p/19q non-codeletion group. According to the results of receiver operating characteristic analysis, these features were observed to have certain diagnostic abilities, especially with regard to combination parameters, which had a high diagnostic capability, with an area under the curve of 0.848. Conclusion: Conventional MRI and CT features, which still represent the most convenient and widely used predictive method, might be a promising noninvasive predictor for differentiating between varied WHO grade II gliomas. Patients with calcification and T1 nonenhancement are more likely to be IDH-mutant.

Currently, LGG treatment involves either or a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Despite the knowledge of constitutive genetic risk factors contributing to gliomas, the role of single genes as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers is limited. The aim of the current study is to discover the predictive and prognostic genetic markers for LGG. Methods: Transcriptome data and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We first performed the tumor microenvironment (TME) survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method. An analysis was undertaken to screen for differentially expressed genes. The function of these genes was studied by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Following which a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed and visualized. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses were performed to obtain the probable prognostic genes. The key genes were selected by an intersection of core and prognostic genes. A clinical correlation analysis of single-gene expression was undertaken. GSEA enrichment analysis was performed to identify the function of key genes. Finally, a single gene-related correlation analysis was performed to identify the core immune cells involved in the development of LGG. Results: A total of 529 transcriptome data and 515 clinical samples were obtained from the TCGA. Immune cells and stromal cells were found to be significantly increased in the LGG microenvironment. The top five core genes intersected with the top 38 prognostically relevant genes and two key genes were identified. Our analysis revealed that a high expression of HLA-DRA was associated with a poor prognosis of LGG. Correlation analysis of immune cells showed that HLA-DRA expression level was related to immune infiltration, positively related to macrophage M1 phenotype, and negatively related to activation of NK cells.

Grade II (GII) gliomas are prone to develop into anaplastic grade III (GIII) gliomas, which indicate a higher malignancy and poorer survival outcome. This study aimed to satisfy the increasing demand for novel sensitive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of GII and GIII gliomas. Methods: A TCGA dataset was used to investigate the expression of H2BC12 mRNA in GII and GIII gliomas and its relation to clinical pathologic characteristics. Glioma tissues were collected to verify results from the TCGA dataset, and H2BC12 mRNA was detected by RT-qPCR. ROC analysis was employed to evaluate the classification power for GII and GIII. The significance of H2BC12 mRNA GII and GIII gliomas was also investigated. In addition, H2BC12 expression-related pathways were enriched by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). DNA methylation level and mutation of H2BC12 were analyzed by the UALCAN and CBioPortal databases, respectively. Results: Based on the sample data from multiple databases and RT-qPCR, higher expression of H2BC12 mRNA was found in GII and GIII glioma tissue compared to normal tissue, which was consistent with a trend with our clinical specimen. H2BC12 mRNA had a better power in distinguishing between GII and GIII and yielded an AUC of 0.706 with a sensitivity of 76.9% and specificity of 81.8%. Meanwhile, high H2BC12 levels were associated with IDH status, 1p/19q codeletion, primary therapy outcome, and the histological type of gliomas. Moreover, the overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progress-free interval (PFI) of GII glioma patients with higher levels of H2BC12 were shorter than those of patients with lower levels as well as GIII patients. In the multivariate analysis, a high H2BC12 level was an independent predictor for poor survival outcomes of gliomas. The Wnt or PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and DNA double-strand break repair were differentially activated in phenotypes that were positively associated with H2BC12.

They belong to heterodimer transmembrane glycoproteins. Its main function in organisms is as the receptor of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and extracellular matrix (ECM). According to the current research integration analysis, integrin α9 (ITGA9) is one of the integrin subunits, and there are few studies on ITGA9 among integrins. ITGA9 can improve cell migration and regulate various cellular biological functions, such as tumor cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion, and angiogenesis. But its abnormal expression mechanism in cancer and its specific role in tumor growth and metastasis are still unknown to a great extent. This review reveals the role of ITGA9 in the complex pathogenesis of many tumors and cancers, providing a new direction for the treatment of tumors and cancers. Relevant studies were retrieved and collected through the PubMed system. After determining ITGA9 as the research object, we found the close relationship between ITGA9 and tumorigenesis through the analysis of the research articles on ITGA9 in the PubMed system in the last 15 years, and further determined the references mainly based on the influencing factors of the articles. Thus, the role of ITGA9 in tumor and cancer genesis, proliferation, and metastasis was reviewed and analyzed. ITGA9 is an integrin subunit, which has been proved to be abnormally expressed in many tumors. After sorting and analyzing the research data, it was found that the abnormal expression of ITGA9 in a variety of tumors, including glioblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer, was closely related to the proliferation, metastasis, adhesion, and angiogenesis of tumor cells.

In spite of some progress in diagnosis and treatment, glioblastoma patients still have a poor prognosis. Hence, to improve glioblastoma diagnosis, finding novel non-invasive biomarkers, e.g., miRNA-based biomarkers, is of importance. Methods: A pair of 50 glioblastoma and healthy samples was used. The expression of each candidate miRNA (i.e., hsa-let-7c-5p, hsa-miR-206-5p, and hsa-miR-1909-5p) was measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. To show the roles of each miRNA and their biological effects on glioblastoma development, in silico tools were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of each miRNA; the possible association of their expression with clinicopathological characteristics was also analyzed.

Purpose: To compare the diagnostic performance of amide proton transfer (APT) and four diffusion models in gliomas grading and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genotype.  Study type: Prospective.  Population: A total of 62 participants (37 males, 25 females; mean age, 52 ± 13 years) whose IDH genotypes were mutant in 6 of 14 grade II gliomas, 8 of 20 of grade III gliomas, and 4 of 28 grade IV gliomas.  Field strength/sequence: APT imaging using sampling perfection with application optimized contrasts by using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) and DWI with q-space Cartesian grid sampling were acquired at 3 T.  Assessment: The ability of diffusion kurtosis imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), mean apparent propagator (MAP), and APT imaging for glioma grade and IDH status were assessed, with histopathological grade and genetic testing used as a reference standard.

The present study aims to assess the diagnostic and prognostic values of preoperative stem cell factor (SCF) plasma level in GBM patients.  Methods: Preoperative plasma samples from 58 GBM patients and 20 patients with nonglial tumors and 30 healthy controls were obtained. SCF levels were measured by employing the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test and the values were compared between these three groups. Then, the association of SCF plasma level and tumor volume, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) for the GBM patients were evaluated.  Results: Mean preoperative SCF plasma level of the GBM patients (2.80 ± 1.52 ng/ml) was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than the healthy controls (0.80 ± 0.24 ng/ml) and patients with nonglial tumor (1.41 ± 0.76 ng/ml). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the preoperative SCF plasma level could distinguish the GBM patients from healthy controls and patients with nonglial tumors with the area under curve values of 0.915 and 0.790, respectively. However, no significant association was observed between the GBM patients preoperative SCF plasma levels and tumors volume (Spearman Rho correlation coefficient, 0.1847; 95% CI, p = 0.1652). The GBM patients were divided into two subgroups based on mean preoperative SCF plasma levels (2.80 ng/ml). No significant difference was observed between the patients PFS (p = 0.3792) and OS (p = 0.1469) at these two subgroups.

Understanding the pathogenesis of tumors at the molecular level is essential for clinical treatment. We conducted a retrospective study on the epidemiology of brain tumors in children based on clinical data obtained from a neurosurgical center. After identifying the most prevalent tumor subtype, we identified new potential diagnostic biomarkers through bioinformatics analysis of the public database. All children (0-15 years) with brain tumors diagnosed histopathologically between 2010 and 2020 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, were reviewed retrospectively for age distribution, sex predilection, native location, tumor location, symptoms, and histological grade, and identified the most common tumor subtypes. Two datasets (GSE44971 and GSE44684) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, whereas the GSE44971 dataset was used to screen the differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor samples. Gene ontology, disease ontology, and gene set enrichment analysis enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of differentially expressed genes in the tumor. Combined with methylation data in the GSE44684 dataset, we further analyzed the correlation between methylation and gene expression levels. Two algorithms, LASSO and SVM-RFE, were used to select the hub genes of the tumor. The diagnostic value of the hub genes was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Finally, we further evaluated the relationship between the hub gene and the tumor microenvironment and immune gene sets. Overall, 650 children from 18 provinces in China were included in this study. The male-to-female ratio was 1.41:1, and the number of patients reached a peak in the 10-15-year-old group (41.4%).The most common symptoms we encountered in our institute were headache and dizziness 250 (28.2%), and nausea and vomiting 228 (25.7%). The predominant location is supratentorial, with a supratentorial to infratentorial ratio of 1.74:1. Low-grade tumors (WHO I/II) constituted 60.9% of all cases and were predominant in every age group. According to basic classification, the most common tumor subtype is pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). A total of 3264 differentially expressed genes were identified in the GSE44971 dataset, which are mainly involved in the process of neural signal transduction, immunity, and some diseases. Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of 45 differentially expressed genes was negatively correlated with promoter DNA methylation. Next, we acquired five hub genes (NCKAP1L, GPR37L1, CSPG4, PPFIA4, and C8orf46) from the 45 differentially expressed genes by intersecting the LASSO and SVM-RFE models. The ROC analysis revealed that the five hub genes had good diagnostic value for patients with PA (AUC > 0.99). Furthermore, the expression of NCKAP1L was negatively correlated with immune, stromal, and estimated scores, and positively correlated with immune gene sets. This study, based on the data analysis of intracranial tumors in children in a single center over the past 10 years, reflected the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of intracranial tumors in children in Northwest China to a certain extent. PA is considered the most common subtype of intracranial tumors in children.

Members of the carbohydrate sulfotransferase (CHST) family are deregulated in various cancer types. However, limited data are available on the role of the members of the CHST family in the development of GBM. The present study aimed to identify the role of significant members of the CHST family in GBM and explore the effects and molecular mechanisms of these significant members on GBM cell proliferation and mobility. In the current study, we demonstrated that CHST12 is the only member of CHST family that is upregulated in GBM tissues and associated with a lower survival rate according to the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Similarly, the expression of CHST12 increased in GBM tissues than in adjacent tissues and had an important diagnostic value in distinguishing tumor tissues from adjacent tissues. The high expression of CHST12 indicated a lower overall survival rate, was negatively associated with the Karnofsky Performance Scale score, was positively associated with the KI67 expression rate, and was an independent risk factor for GBM. Knockdown of CHST12 significantly decreased GBM cell proliferation and mobility and inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Restoration of β-catenin expression in GBM cells reversed the inhibitory effects of CHST12 knockdown on GBM cell proliferation and mobility.

Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) is a critical autophagy-associated protein with roles in oncogenesis and tumor progression. However, the contribution of VMP1 to glioma development as well as its prognostic value has not been established. Methods: The expression of VMP1 and clinicopathologic data for 1996 glioma samples were collected from authoritative public databases to explore its prognostic value. Lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system was performed to deplete VMP1 expression. Apoptosis assays, cell cycle assays, colony formation assays, and EdU incorporation analysis were conducted to validate the biological function of VMP1. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the role of VMP1 in regulating autophagy. Results: VMP1 overexpression was associated with advanced disease and had a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. The depletion of VMP1 by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing significantly inhibited cell proliferation, increased cell death, and induced cell cycle arrest. Mechanistically, VMP1 knockout blocked autophagic flux and thus sensitized glioma cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Moreover, a nomogram model showed that VMP1 expression has high prognostic value for determining survival in glioma.

Herein, we aimed to assess the diagnostic value of gyriform infiltration as an imaging marker for molecular glioblastomas.  Methods: Two independent investigators reviewed the MRI scans from patients with newly diagnosed gliomas for the presence of a gyriform infiltration defined as an elective cortical hypersignal on MRI FLAIR sequence. Diagnostic test performance of this sign for the diagnosis of molecular glioblastoma were calculated.  Results: A total of 426 patients were included, corresponding to 31 molecular glioblastoma, 294 IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, 50 IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and 51 IDH-mutant 1p19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma.

The function of AP1S3 is special in numerous diseases, but its exact role in glioma remains unknown. Methods Bioinformatics analysis was performed at the beginning. Based on TCGA database, differentially expressed genes were obtained. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis is performed by STRING. The annotation, visualization, and synthesis (DAVID) discovery database program was used for gene ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. The Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted to determine the prognostic value of AP1S3 Also, in vitro experiments were conducted in our research. Results 4370 differentially expressed genes were identified. 215 key genes were screened by protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis; AP1S3 had a higher degree. The top five enriched pathways related to AP1S3 contain protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), extracellular matrix receptor (ECM receptor) interaction, focal adhesion, advanced glycation end product (AGE) receptor for AGE (RAGE) signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and mRNA surveillance pathway. Additionally, the AP1S3 level was dramatically upregulated in glioblastoma (GBM) samples, but greatly reduced in low-grade glioma (LGG) samples when compared to that in normal tissues. The Kaplan-Meier curve data showed that AP1S3 was closely related to the disease-free survival (DFS) of glioma. Our data suggested that the expression of AP1S3 was increased in glioma in comparison with normal tissues, in line with the data of clinical samples. What was more, our data demonstrated that the reduction of AP1S3 in glioma cells could result in the inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.

While accumulating studies have investigated coding gene-associated biomarkers in malignant glioma, research on comprehensive coding and noncoding RNA-associated biomarkers is lacking. Furthermore, few studies have illustrated the cross-talk signalling pathways among these biomarkers and mechanisms in detail. Here, we identified DEGs and ceRNA networks in malignant glioma and then constructed Cox/Lasso regression models to further identify the most valuable genes through stepwise refinement. Top-down comprehensive integrated analysis, including functional enrichment, SNV, immune infiltration, transcription factor binding site, and molecular docking analyses, further revealed the regulatory maps among these genes. The results revealed a novel and accurate model (AUC of 0.91 and C-index of 0.84 in the whole malignant gliomas, AUC of 0.90 and C-index of 0.86 in LGG, and AUC of 0.75 and C-index of 0.69 in GBM) that includes twelve ncRNAs, 1 miRNA and 6 coding genes. Stepwise logical reasoning based on top-down comprehensive integrated analysis and references revealed cross-talk signalling pathways among these genes that were correlated with the circadian rhythm, tumour immune microenvironment and cellular senescence pathways.

Because gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system tumor and glioblastomas have poor prognosis, it is urgent to develop new diagnostic methods. We have previously reported that lncRNA HOXD-AS2, which is specifically up-regulated in gliomas, can activate cell cycle and promote the development of gliomas. It is expected to be a new marker for molecular diagnosis of gliomas, but little is known about HOXD-AS2. Here, we demonstrate that TFE3 and miR-661 maintain the high expression level of HOXD-AS2 by regulating its production and degradation.

Many studies have linked SPP1 to pathophysiological conditions including cancer.  Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the 3UTR length of SPP1 gene in glioblastoma cell line.  Methods: 3 Rapid Amplification of cDNA End (3-RACE) were used to determine the 3 end of SPP1 gene. APAatlas data base, GEPIA web server, and miRcode were also used to extract related information and bioinformatic analysis part.  Results: In this study we show that SPP1 gene undergoes Alternative cleavage and Polyadenylation (APA) mechanism, by which it generates two 3 termini, longer isoform and shorter isoform, in glioblastoma derived cell line, U87-MG. Further bioinformatic analysis reveals that SPP1 alternative 3UTR (aUTR), which is absent in shorter isoform, is targeted by two families of microRNAs-miR-181abcd/4262 and miR-154/872.

It is one of the most prevailing primary brain tumors, particularly in human male adults. Even though the combination therapy comprises surgery, chemotherapy, and adjuvant therapies, the survival rate is on average 14.6 months. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have key roles in tumorigenesis, progression, and counteracting chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In our study, firstly, the gene expression dataset GSE45117 was retrieved and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were spotted. The co-expression network analysis was employed on DEGs to find the significant modules. The most significant module resulting from co-expression analysis was the turquoise module. The turquoise module related to the tumor cells, hypoxia, normoxic treatments of glioblastoma tumor (GBT), and GSCs were screened. Sixty-one common genes in the turquoise module were selected generated through the co-expression analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Moreover, the GO and KEGG pathway enrichment results were studied. Twenty common hub genes were screened by the NetworkAnalyst web instrument constructed on the PPI network through the STRING database. After survival analysis via the Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified the five most significant hub genes strongly related to the progression of GBM.

Recently we showed that the FREM2 gene has a role in glioblastoma progression. Here we reconstructed the FREM2 molecular pathway using the human interactome model. We assessed the biomarker capacity of FREM2 expression and its pathway as the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) biomarkers. To this end, we used three literature and one experimental RNA sequencing datasets collectively covering 566 glioblastomas (GBM) and 1097 low-grade gliomas (LGG). The activation level of deduced FREM2 pathway showed strong biomarker characteristics and significantly outperformed the FREM2 expression level itself. For all relevant datasets, it could robustly discriminate GBM and LGG (p < 1.63 × 10-13, AUC > 0.74). High FREM2 pathway activation level was associated with poor OS in LGG (p < 0.001), and low PFS in LGG (p < 0.001) and GBM (p < 0.05).

Discussion on their therapeutic perspectives","At present, brain tumours remain one of the ""hard-to-treat"" malignancies with minimal improvement in patients survival. Recently, miRNAs have been shown to correlate with oncogenesis and metastasis and have been investigated as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy prediction in different brain malignancies. The aim of the current study was to select an accurate and affordable brain tumour detection and grading approach. In the present study, we analysed the applicability of a restricted miRNA signature that could differentiate among patients with primary as well as metastatic brain tumours. Fresh tumour tissues were collected from Bulgarian patients (n = 38), including high-grade gliomas (n = 23), low-grade gliomas (n = 10) and brain metastases (n = 5) from lung cancer. Total RNAs enriched with microRNAs were isolated and differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed by RT-qPCR using TaqMan Advanced miRNA assay. We selected a signature of miR-21, miR-10b, miR-7, miR-491 that showed good diagnostic potential in high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas and brain metastases compared with normal brain tissues.

Defects in alternative splicing process are frequent in cancer. Recently, we demonstrated that dysregulation of the spliceosome is directly associated with glioma development, progression, and aggressiveness.  Methods: Different human cohorts and a dataset from different glioma mouse models were analyzed to determine the mutation frequency as well as the gene and protein expression levels between tumor and control samples of the splicing-factor-3B-subunit-1 (SF3B1), an essential and druggable spliceosome component. SF3B1 expression was also explored at the single-cell level across all cell subpopulations and transcriptomic programs. The association of SF3B1 expression with relevant clinical data (e.g., overall survival) in different human cohorts was also analyzed. Different functional (proliferation/migration/tumorspheres and colonies formation/VEGF secretion/apoptosis) and mechanistic (gene expression/signaling pathways) assays were performed in three different glioblastomas cell models (human primary cultures and cell lines) in response to SF3B1 blockade (using pladienolide B treatment). Moreover, tumor progression and formation were monitored in response to SF3B1 blockade in two preclinical xenograft glioblastoma mouse models.  Results: Our data provide novel evidence demonstrating that the splicing-factor-3B-subunit-1 (SF3B1, an essential and druggable spliceosome component) is low-frequency mutated in human gliomas (~ 1 %) but widely overexpressed in glioblastoma compared with control samples from the different human cohorts and mouse models included in the present study, wherein SF3B1 levels are associated with key molecular and clinical features (e.g., overall survival, poor prognosis and/or drug resistance). Remarkably, in vitro and in vivo blockade of SF3B1 activity with pladienolide B drastically altered multiple glioblastoma pathophysiological processes (i.e., reduction in proliferation, migration, tumorspheres formation, VEGF secretion, tumor initiation and increased apoptosis) likely by suppressing AKT/mTOR/ß-catenin pathways, and an imbalance of BCL2L1 splicing.

To change poor prognosis, it is necessary to deeply understand the molecular mechanisms of gliomagenesis and identify new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) help in maintaining genome stability, and their deregulation has already been observed in many tumors. Recent studies suggest that these molecules could also play an important role in the glioma biology. To determine GBM-associated piRNAs, we performed small RNA sequencing analysis in the discovery set of 19 GBM and 11 non-tumor brain samples followed by TaqMan qRT-PCR analyses in the independent set of 77 GBM and 23 non-tumor patients. Obtained data were subsequently bioinformatically analyzed. Small RNA sequencing revealed 58 significantly deregulated piRNA molecules in GBM samples in comparison with non-tumor brain tissues.

However, its role in the development of glioma has remained elusive. Therefore, the present study sought to determine the association between the expression levels of COL4A1 and the clinical characteristics of gliomas by analyzing large samples. First, analysis of thousands of glioma tissue samples collected from the Gene expression profiling interactive analysis, Gene Expression Omnibus database, the Ivy glioblastoma atlas, The Human Protein Atlas, Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas and The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, glioma tissues and normal brain tissues from patients with glioma and epilepsy undergoing surgical resection were collected. These samples, which were subjected to a variety of different detection techniques (including sequencing data, chip data, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, cell lines and tissue samples, in situ hybridization and immunology) revealed that COL4A1 expression was not only increased at the mRNA level but also at the protein level as compared with that in normal brain tissue. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that COL4A1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival of patients, particularly those with World Health Organization grade III glioma. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested that COL4A1 had a moderate diagnostic value for glioma. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that the expression levels of COL4A1 were positively associated with the histological type and historical grade of the tumor, patient age, Primary, Recurrent, Secondary type and the chemotherapy status, and negatively associated with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation and 1p19q co-deletion (P<0.001). Gene-set enrichment analysis indicated that overexpression of COL4A1 promoted cancer-associated pathways, such as the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and cell cycle regulation. Finally, an MTT assay, immunohistochemical analysis of the cell cycle regulator KI67 and a wound-healing assay further confirmed that knockdown of COL4A1 inhibited the proliferation and migration ability of glioma cells.

However, these studies only focus on a few types of immune cells. Our study aims to comprehensively explore the role of CD74 in glioma prognosis and immune microenvironment. Methods: A total of 40 glioma specimens were collected in this study. We extracted data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and Gene-Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to explore the expression pattern of CD74 in gliomas. gene sets enrichment analysis and gene set variation analysis analyses were conducted to characterize the immune features of CD74. ESTIMATE, ssGSEA, Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource, and CIBERSORT algorithms were applied to assess the immune infiltration. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for survival analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of CD74 in glioma diagnosis and prognosis. Results: A total of 2,399 glioma patients were included in our study. CD74 was highly expressed in glioma tissue compared to normal brain tissue and its expression was significantly higher in the high-grade glioma compared to the lower grade glioma at transcriptional and translational levels. Besides, CD74 was positively associated with immune checkpoints and inflammatory cytokines as well as immune processes including cytokine secretion and leukocyte activation. The high expression of CD74 indicated a high infiltration of immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. Moreover, patients with high expression of CD74 had poor prognoses.

However, the mechanism of MDK in GBM remains elusive. Methods: A public GBM-related dataset and GBM tissues from our center were used validate the aberrant expression of MDK in GBM at the RNA and protein levels. The relationship between MDK expression and survival of GBM patients was also explored through survival analysis. Subsequently, we identified MDK-related GBM-specific genes using differential expression analysis. Functional enrichment analyses were performed to reveal their potential biological functions. CCK-8, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine, and Matrigel-transwell assays were performed in GBM cell lines in which MDK was knocked out or overexpressed in order assess the effects of MDK on proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells. Western blotting was performed to detect candidate proteins.

Therefore, it is urgent to find out more effective molecular prognostic markers. The role of the Fam20 kinase family in different tumors was an emerging research field. However, the biological function of Fam20C and its prognostic value in brain tumors have rarely been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the value of Fam20C as a potential prognostic marker for LGG. A total of 761 LGG samples (our cohort, TCGA and CGGA) were included to investigate the expression and role of Fam20C in LGG. We found that Fam20C was drastically overexpressed in LGG and was positively associated with its clinical progression. Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox regression model were employed to evaluate its prognostic value, and Fam20C was found as an independent risk factor in LGG patients. Gene set enrichment analysis also revealed the potential signaling pathways associated with Fam20C gene expression in LGG; these pathways were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix receptor interactions, cell adhesion, cell apoptosis, NOTCH signaling, cell cycle, etc. In summary, our findings provide insights for understanding the potential role of Fam20C and its application as a new prognostic biomarker for LGG.",FAM20C; LGG; bioinformatics; biomarker; lower-grade gliomas; prognosis,Fam20C,Fam20C,Our results showed that Fam20C is a promising biomarker for LGG diagnosis and prognosis.,Protein Biomarker,NA,"Diagnositic,Prognostic","Tier 3, Biomarker is validated in pre-clinical research",China,100,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I,II,III",Tissue,Immunohistochemistry,NA,NA,"1.

Recent studies have highlighted its role in the central nervous system and revealed hints in the development of glioma. However, the expression profiles of STOX1, its association with clinicopathological characteristics, and potential functions in glioma remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed three publicly available datasets including CGGA, TCGA, and Rembrandt and revealed a grade-dependent reduction in STOX1 expression in glioma (P < 0.001). Chi-square test demonstrated that low STOX1 expression was significantly associated with older age at initial diagnosis (P < 0.001), less IDH1 mutation (P < 0.001), and advanced WHO grade (P < 0.001). Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that STOX1 expression may serve as a novel independent prognostic biomarker in glioma patients.

However, it remains unclear whether ELK3, as a key gene, affects the pathological process of gliomas and the prognosis of patients with gliomas. This study aimed to comprehensively and systematically reveal the correlation between ELK3 and the malignant progression of gliomas by analyzing clinical sample information stored in multiple databases. We revealed the putative mechanism of ELK3 involvement in malignant gliomas progression and identified a new and efficient biomarker for glioma diagnosis and targeted therapy. Based on the sample data from multiple databases and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the abnormally high expression of ELK3 in gliomas was confirmed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses demonstrated that a high ELK3 expression was markedly associated with low patient survival and served as an independent biomarker of gliomas. Wilcox and Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that expression of ELK3 was positively correlated with several clinical characteristics of patients with gliomas, such as age, WHO classification, and recurrence. Moreover, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), immunofluorescence, and wound healing assays confirmed that ELK3 overexpression markedly promoted the proliferation and migration of glioma cells. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and western blotting confirmed that overexpression of ELK3 regulated the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and upregulate the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and phosphorylated STAT3 (P-STAT3) to promote the malignant transition of gliomas.

Exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier and are readily accessible in human biofluids, making them promising biomarkers for HGA. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have potential as tumor biomarkers owing to their stability, conservation, and tissue specificity. However, the landscape and characteristics of exosome circRNAs in HGA remain to be studied.  Methods: CircRNA deep sequencing and bioinformatics approaches were used to generate a circRNA profiling database and analyze the features of HGA cell circRNAs and HGA cell-derived exosome circRNAs. Exosome circRNA expression in the serum and tissues of healthy individuals and patients with HGA was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic curve and overall survival curves were analyzed.  Results: By investigating the characteristics of HGA cell-derived exosome circRNAs and HGA cell circRNAs, we observed that exosomes were more likely to enrich short-exon and suppressor circRNAs than HGA cells. Moreover, a serum exosome circRNA panel including hsa_circ_0075828, hsa_circ_0003828, and hsa_circ_0002976 could be used to screen for HGA, whereas a good prognosis panel comprised high concentrations of hsa_circ_0005019, hsa_circ_0000880, hsa_circ_0051680, and hsa_circ_0006365.

Cancer-derived immunoglobulin G (cancer-IgG) has been found to be widely expressed in several malignancies such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. Cancer-IgG could promote tumorigenesis and progression. However, its role in glioma has not been revealed yet. Methods: We mined open databases including the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to study the role of IGHG1, which encodes cancer-IgG in glioma. Examination of the differential expression of IGHG1 was carried out in the GEO and TCGA databases. Furthermore, its expression in different molecular subtypes was analyzed. Stratified analysis was performed with clinical features. Subsequently, immune infiltration analysis was conducted using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). GSEA was performed to reveal the mechanisms of IGHG1. Lastly, immunohistochemistry was processed to validate our findings. Results: In this study, we found that the expression of IGHG1 was higher in glioma and molecular subtypes with poor prognosis.

While the original classification relied on an 840 gene-set, further clarification on true GBM subtypes uses a 150-gene signature to accurately classify GBM into the three subtypes. We hypothesized whether a machine learning approach could be used to identify a smaller gene-set to accurately predict GBM subtype. Methods: Using a supervised machine learning approach, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), we developed a classifier to predict the three subtypes of glioblastoma (GBM): classical, mesenchymal, and proneural. We tested the classifier on in-house GBM tissue, cell lines, and xenograft samples to predict their subtype. Results: We identified the five most important genes for characterizing the three subtypes based on genes that often exhibited high Importance Scores in our XGBoost analyses. On average, this approach achieved 80.12% accuracy in predicting these three subtypes of GBM. Furthermore, we applied our five-gene classifier to successfully predict the subtype of GBM samples at our centre.

Here, we discover that PDRG1 is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the clinical significance, biological role, and underlying molecular mechanisms of PDRG1 in GBM remain unclear. PDRG1 was aberrantly overexpressed in glioma, especially prevalent in GBM, and correlated with poor clinicopathologic features of glioma. The risk score, operational feature curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier curve, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that PDRG1 was an independent prognostic indicator and significantly correlates with disease progression of glioma. A prognostic nomogram was constructed to predict the survival risk of individual patients. The function and pathway enrichment analysis of PDRG1 in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort was performed. PDRG1 knockdown significantly inhibited the migration and proliferation of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of PDRG1 knockdown U-118 MG(U118) cells indicated that biological regulation adhesion, growth and death, cell motility, cell adhesion molecular and proteoglycans in cancer were significantly enriched.

Description of easily accessible and effective biomarkers present in biofluids would thus prove invaluable in GB diagnosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from both GB and stromal cells are essential to intercellular crosstalk in the tumour bulk, and circulating EVs have been described as a potential reservoir of GB biomarkers. Therefore, EV-based liquid biopsies have been suggested as a promising tool for GB diagnosis and follow up. To identify GB specific proteins, sEVs were isolated from plasma samples of GB patients as well as healthy volunteers using differential ultracentrifugation, and their content was characterised through mass spectrometry. Our data indicate the presence of an inflammatory biomarker signature comprising members of the complement and regulators of inflammation and coagulation including VWF, FCGBP, C3, PROS1, and SERPINA1. Overall, this study is a step forward in the development of a non-invasive liquid biopsy approach for the identification of valuable biomarkers that could significantly improve GB diagnosis and, consequently, patients prognosis and quality of life.",extracellular vesicles; glioblastoma; liquid biopsy,VWF; FCGBP; C3; PROS1; SERPINA1,VWF; FCGBP; C3; PROS1; SERPINA1,An inﬂammatory biomarker signature was described in sEVs from GB patients.

Whereas genetic loci with allelic deletion often implicate tumor suppressor genes, a putative tumor suppressor Adducin3 (ADD3) mapped to chromosome 10q25.2 was found to be preferentially downregulated in high-grade gliomas compared with low-grade lesions. In this study, we unveil how the assessment of ADD3 deletion provides clinical significance in glioblastoma (GBM). By deletion mapping, we assessed the frequency of LOH in forty-three glioma specimens using five microsatellite markers spanning chromosome 10q23-10qter. Data were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort with 203 GBM patients. We found that allelic loss in both D10S173 (ADD3/MXI1 locus) and D10S1137 (MGMT locus) were positively associated with tumor grading and proliferative index (MIB-1). However, LOH events at only the ADD3/MXI1 locus provided prognostic significance with a marked reduction in patient survival and appeared to have diagnostic potential in differentiating high-grade gliomas from low-grade ones. Furthermore, we showed progressive loss of ADD3 in six out of seven patient-paired gliomas with malignant progression, as well as in recurrent GBMs. These findings suggest the significance of ADD3/MXI1 locus as a promising marker that can be used to refine the LOH10q assessment. Data further suggest the role of ADD3 as a novel tumor suppressor, whereby the loss of ADD3 is indicative of a progressive disease that may at least partially account for rapid disease progression in GBM.

To improve patient outcomes, effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for GBM are needed. In this study, we first applied bioinformatic analyses to identify biomarkers for GBM, focusing on SOX (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY)-related high mobility group (HMG) box) B1 family members. The ONCOMINE, GEPIA, LinkedOmics and CCLE databases were used to assess mRNA expression levels of the SOX B1 family members in different cancers and normal tissue. Further bioinformatic analysis was performed using the ONCOMINE database in combination with the LinkedOmics data set to identify the prognostic value of SOX B1 family members for GBM. We found mRNA expression levels of all tested SOX B1 genes were significantly increased in GBM. In the LinkedOmics database, increased expression of SOX3 indicated a better overall survival. In GEPIA databases, increased expression of all SOX B1 family members suggested an improved overall survival, but none of them were statistically different. Then, Transwell assays and wound healing were employed to evaluate the motility and invasive captivity of U251 cells when silencing SOX2 and SOX3. We found exogenous inhibition of SOX2 appeared to reduce the migration and invasion of U251 cells in vitro.

They make up about 40% of all primary brain tumors and around 70% of all primary malignant brain tumors. They can occur anywhere in the central nervous system (CNS) and have a poor prognosis. The average survival of glioma patients is approximately 6-15 months with poor aspects of life. In this edge, identification of proteins secreted by cancer cells is of special interest because it may provide a better understanding of tumor progression and provide early diagnosis of the diseases. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from pooled plasma of healthy controls (n=03) and patients with different grades of glioma (Grade I or II or III, n=03 each). Nanoparticle tracking analysis, western blot, and flow cytometry were performed to determine the size, morphology, the concentration of glioma-derived vesicles and EV marker, CD63. Further, iTRAQ-based LC-MS/MS analysis of EV protein was performed to determine the differential protein abundance in extracellular vesicles across different glioma grades. We further verified galectin-3 binding protein (LGALS3BP) by ELISA in individual blood plasma and plasma-derived vesicles from control and glioma patients (n=40 each). Analysis by Max Quant identified 123 proteins from the pooled patient exosomes, out of which 34, 21, and 14 proteins were found to be differentially abundant by more than 1.3-fold in the different grades of glioma grade I, pilocytic astrocytoma; grade II, diffuse astrocytoma; grade III, anaplastic astrocytoma, respectively, in comparison with the control samples.
