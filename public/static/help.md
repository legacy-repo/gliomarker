## The constraction of GlioMarker
The flowchart of GlioMarker construction was shown in Figure1, including literature-based mining,  biological function investigations，and high-throughput datasets verification. <br />![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/358193/1616245035525-329a1b2c-d076-47b3-b14d-74216192ca59.png#align=left&display=inline&height=570&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=1140&originWidth=802&size=160218&status=done&style=none&width=401)<br />Figure 1: The flowchart of GlioMarker construction

## Data Selection Criteria
To guarantee the high quality of data collection, all the data for GlioMarker are collected from the public database PubMed by manually text mining. The detailed literature searching was performed in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed) using the keywords ["gliomas", "glial cell tumors", "glioblastoma", "astrocytoma", "oligodendrogliomas", or "ependymoma"] and ["biomarker" or  "indicator", "marker" or "predictor"] and ["diagnostic" or "diagnosis"]. Figure 2 shows the procedure of data collection.<br />![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/358193/1616245341852-c5a81b6b-48aa-44bc-a619-1568c19adf30.png#align=left&display=inline&height=548&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=1096&originWidth=760&size=144592&status=done&style=none&width=380)<br />Figure2: The pipeline of literature curation
